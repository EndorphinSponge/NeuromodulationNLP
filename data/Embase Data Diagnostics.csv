0,"OBJECT: The authors evaluated the preclinical feasibility of acutely stabilizing an active bihemispheric limbic epileptic circuit using closed-loop direct neurostimulation therapy in tandem with ""on-demand"" convection-enhanced intracerebral delivery of the antiepileptic drug (AED) carisbamate. A rat model of electrically induced self-sustained focal-onset epilepsy was employed. METHOD(S): A 16-contact depth-recording microelectrode was implanted bilaterally in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of Fischer 344 rats. The right microelectrode array included an integrated microcatheter for drug delivery at the distal tip. Bihemispheric spontaneous self-sustained limbic status epilepticus (SSLSE) was induced in freely moving rats using a 90-minute stimulation paradigm delivered to the right medial perforant white matter pathway. Immediately following SSLSE induction, closed-loop right PP stimulation therapy concurrent with on-demand nanoboluses of the AED [14C]-carisbamate (n = 4), or on-demand [14C]-carisbamate alone (n = 4), was introduced for a mean of 10 hours. In addition, 2 reference groups received either closed-loop stimulation therapy alone (n = 4) or stimulation therapy with saline vehicle only (n = 4). All animals were sacrificed after completing the specified therapy regimen. In situ [14C]-autoradiography was used to determine AED distribution. RESULT(S): Closed-loop direct stimulation therapy delivered unilaterally in the right PP aborted ictal runs detected in either ipsi-or contralateral hippocampi. Freely moving rats receiving closed-loop direct stimulation therapy with on demand intracerebral carisbamate delivery experienced a significant reduction in seizure frequency (p < 0.001) and minimized seizure frequency variability during the final 50% of the therapy/recording session compared with closed-loop stimulation therapy alone. CONCLUSION(S): Unilateral closed-loop direct stimulation therapy delivered to afferent hippocampal white matter pathways concurrent with on-demand ipsilateral intracerebral delivery of nano-bolused carisbamate can rapidly decrease the frequency of electrographic seizures in an active bihemispheric epileptic network. Additionally, direct pulsatile delivery of carisbamate can stabilize seizure frequency variability compared with direct stimulation therapy alone.Copyright © AANS, 2015.",0,,,
1,"For the past decades, transcranial magnetic stimulation-the method based on the application of magnetic field to the intact brain through the stimulation coil-has been extensively used for investigations of the excitability of the brain. The method is safe and well tolerable in the child population. Existing data suggest three main indications for transcranial magnetic stimulation application in epilepsy as follows: (1) diagnostic measures of cortical excitability; (2) noninvasive functional mapping of epileptogenic zone and cortex prior surgery; and (3) therapeutic modulation of cortical excitability. The abovementioned application areas are reviewed with emphasizing particular aspects in children.Copyright © 2015 by Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart * New York.",0,,,
2,"Objective We studied patients treated with chronic DBS in whom there was depletion of the generator's battery, in order to get insight on the modulatory potential of chronic DBS in refractory epilepsy. Material Nine adult patients with refractory epilepsy treated with at least three years of deep brain stimulation (DBS), and who were followed up for at least six months after battery depletion were studied. One patient was treated with hippocampal DBS (Hip-DBS), two to centro-median DBS (CM-DBS) and six to anterior nucleus stimulation (AN-DBS). Results Two patients did not have seizure's frequency modification after battery depletion; the other seven patients had seizure frequency increase, including those three patients that were seizure-free. Five of those seven patients who had seizure frequency increase after battery's depletion had seizure's frequency lower than their pre-DBS baseline seizure frequency; two of such patients returned to their pre-DBS baseline seizure frequency. Conclusions In the majority of the patients, three years of chronic DBS did not show a permanent effect on epileptogenesis. On the other hand, the post-battery depletion seizure's frequency was usually much lower than the baseline (pre-DBS) seizure's frequency, suggesting that there was actual network neuromodulation.Copyright © 2015 International Neuromodulation Society.",9,,,
3,"Introduction: Drug-resistant epilepsy affects 25% of all epileptic patients, and quality of life decreases in these patients due to their seizures. Early detection is crucial in order to establish potential treatment alternatives and determine if the patient is a surgical candidate. Development: PubMed search for articles, recommendations published by major medical societies, and clinical practice guidelines for drug-resistant epilepsy and its medical and surgical treatment options. Evidence and recommendations are classified according to the criteria of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (2001) and the European Federation of Neurological Societies (2004) for therapeutic actions. Conclusion(s): Identifying patients with drug-resistant epilepsy is important for optimising drug therapy. Experts recommend rational polytherapy with antiepileptic drugs to find more effective combinations with fewer adverse effects. When adequate seizure control is not achieved, a presurgical evaluation in an epilepsy referral centre is recommended. These evaluations explore how to resect the epileptogenic zone without causing functional deficits in cases in which this is feasible. If resective surgery is not achievable, palliative surgery or neurostimulation systems (including vagus nerve, trigeminal nerve, or deep brain stimulation) may be an option. Other treatment alternatives such as ketogenic diet may also be considered in selected patients.Copyright © 2014 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia.",1,,,
4,"Summary Objective Understanding the neural mechanisms that support human consciousness is an important frontier in neuroscience and medicine. We previously developed a rodent model of temporal lobe seizures that recapitulates the human electroencephalography (EEG) signature of ictal and postictal neocortical slow waves associated with behavioral impairments in level of consciousness. The mechanism of slow-wave production in epilepsy may involve suppression of the subcortical arousal systems including the brainstem and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. We hypothesized that intralaminar thalamic stimulation may lead to electrophysiologic and functional rescue from postictal slow waves and behavioral arrest. Methods We electrically stimulated the central lateral thalamic nucleus (a member of the intralaminar nuclei) under anesthesia and after electrically induced hippocampal seizures in anesthetized and in awake-behaving animal model preparations. Results We demonstrated a proof-of-principle restoration of electrophysiologic and behavioral measures of consciousness by stimulating the intralaminar thalamic nuclei after seizures. We measured decreased cortical slow waves and increased desynchronization and multiunit activity in the cortex with thalamic stimulation following seizures. Functionally, thalamic stimulation produced resumption of exploratory behaviors in the postictal state. Significance Targeting of nodes in the neural circuitry of consciousness has important medical implications. Impaired consciousness with epilepsy has dangerous consequences including decreased school/work performance, social stigmatization, and impaired airway protection. These data suggest a novel therapeutic approach for restoring consciousness after seizures. If paired with responsive neurostimulation, this may allow rapid implementation to improve level of consciousness in patients with epilepsy.Copyright © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2014 International League Against Epilepsy.",0,,,
5,"Background: Drug-resistant epileptic patients account for 40 % of cases of epilepsy. Consequently, specific therapeutic options could be surgical resection or, if not indicated, deep brain stimulation (DBS). The aim of this study is to review data from patients affected by drug-resistant complex partial epilepsy with or without generalization treated by anterior thalamic nucleus (AN) DBS to evaluate the efficacy and potential future applications of this approach as a standard method for palliative seizure control. Method(s): Six patients affected by drug-resistant complex partial seizures underwent AN DBS from March 2007 to February 2011. The preoperative tests consisted of electroencephalography (EEG), video EEG, morphologic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), non-acute positron emission tomography (PET), neuropsychological evaluation, Liverpool seizure scale, and Quality Of Life In Epilepsy (QOLIE). These tests and a seizure diary were also administered during a follow-up of at least 3 years. Result(s): The improvement in terms of decrease of seizures was more than 50 % in patients affected by complex partial seizures strictly related to limbic system origin. The amelioration was unsatisfactory for patients having anatomical lesions outside the limbic structures with evidence of late diffusion in limbic areas. One patient died 40 days after surgery for reasons not concerned with DBS. Conclusion(s): Although the limited number of enrolled patients limits the reliability of data, the results are in accordance with those found in the recent literature and deserve to be considered for further studies regarding real efficacy, indications, stimulation parameters, side effects, and complications.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.",6,,,
6,"Objective The optimal sites and stimulation protocols for brain stimulation in epilepsy have not been found. Clinical trials, which have shown modest benefit in seizure reduction, have involved patients with poorly localized intractable focal epilepsy and stimulation sites without clear relations to specific underlying seizure circuits. The medial dorsal thalamic nucleus is a key node in limbic seizure circuits, and we wished to know what stimulation parameters might control seizures in a kindling model of limbic epilepsy. Methods In urethane-anesthetized rats, we induced limbic seizures by stimulation of the piriform cortex or CA3 of the hippocampus while recording in the entorhinal cortex or CA1 of the contralateral hippocampus to determine the effect of specific stimulation parameters on seizure duration. Results Stimulation consistently suppressed seizure duration from baseline by over 80% (p < 0.001), frequently completely preventing the seizures. Position of the thalamic electrode, stimulus intensity and frequency had a significant influence, with higher stimulus intensities (40 V vs. 20 V) and frequencies (20 Hz vs. 7 Hz) significantly suppressing seizures. The most effective position was the lateral dorsal area of the medial dorsal nucleus (MD), which corresponded to the region of axon entry. Stimulation in the MD center was not effective. An anterior-posterior relationship of the stimulating electrode pair was effective, whereas a medial lateral orientation was not. Successful stimulation suppressed the evoked responses in the entorhinal cortex or CA1. Significance Position and orientation of the stimulating electrode has to be precise, which suggests that the placement of the electrodes must be tailored to the individual's own seizure circuit. The data also indicate that successful deep brain stimulation induces a fundamental change in system physiology, which could be a marker to guide the development of stimulation parameters for each patient.Copyright © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2015 International League Against Epilepsy.",0,,40.0,
7,"Objectives The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posteromedial hypothalamus (pHyp) on seizure frequency in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) associated with intractable aggressive behavior (IAB). Methods Data were collected retrospectively from nine patients, who received bilateral stereotactic pHyp-DBS for the treatment of medically intractable aggressive behavior, focusing on five patients who also had DRE. All patients were treated at the Colombian Center and Foundation of Epilepsy and Neurological Diseases - FIRE (Chapter of the International Bureau for Epilepsy), in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia from 2010 to 2014. Each case was evaluated previously by the institutional ethical committee, assessing the impact of aggressive behavior on the patient's family and social life, the humanitarian aspects of preserving the safety and physical integrity of caregivers, and the need to prevent self-harm. Epilepsy improvement was measured by a monthly seizure reduction percentage, comparing preoperative state and outcome. Additional response to epilepsy was defined by reduction of the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Aggressive behavior response was measured using the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS). Results All the patients with DRE associated with IAB presented a significant decrease of the rate of epileptic seizures after up to 4 years follow-up, achieving a general 89.6% average seizure reduction from the state before the surgery. Aggressiveness was significantly controlled, with evident improvement in the OAS, enhancing the quality of life of patients and families. Significance In well-selected patients, DBS of the pHyp seems to be a safe and effective procedure for treatment of DRE associated with refractory aggressive behavior. Larger and prospective series are needed to define the pHyp as a target for DRE in different contexts.Copyright © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2015 International League Against Epilepsy.",9,,,
8,"In epilepsy, novel pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment approaches are commonly assessed in model systems of acute motor and often generalized seizures. We developed a rodent model with short-term electrical stimulation of the perforant path resulting in stereotyped limbic seizures. Limbic structures play a major role in human intractable epilepsy. In 10 rats, single electrical 5-second and 20-Hz stimuli to the perforant path reliably produced limbic seizures characterized by resting behavior and subtle motor signs. Electrophysiological recordings from the dentate gyrus demonstrated a seizure pattern with 4-Hz to 5-Hz discharges. Multiple inductions of seizures within 72 hours did not alter behavioral and electrophysiological seizure characteristics. Electrophysiological excitatory and inhibitory parameters assessed by evoked single and paired pulses did not change with increasing number of seizures. We present preliminary findings on a new model of electrically induced limbic seizures of mesiotemporal origin. This model may represent a reliable screening tool for new treatment approaches such as deep brain stimulation.Copyright © the authors, publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Limited.",0,,,
9,"Objective: To study the efficacy and possible mechanism of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in bilateral anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) for drug-resistant epilepsy. Method(s): Three cases with drug-resistant epilepsy underwent DBS in bilateral ATN. Preoperative and postoperative assessment included the frequency of seizures, seizure types, kinds and dosage of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), and imaging and EEG examination. Result(s): Case 1 was followed up for 28 months, with only one seizure attack occurred due to missing doses. Video EEG (VEEG) during the follow-up period showed that a single unilateral spike-slow wave discharge was found by accident in one year after DBS. As for Case 2, intermittent time was significantly prolonged during the follow-up of 24 months. VEEG during the follow-up period showed interictal right frontal-central-parietal slow wave. Case 3 was followed up for 3 months, and VEEG examination during the follow-up period revealed decrease of diffuse spike-slow wave, while bilateral occipital spike-slow wave could be seen in interictal phase. Without any change of type and dose in taking AEDs after DBS, seizure frequency was reduced by 100% in Case 1, 25% in Case 2, and almost 55% in Case 3. Conclusion(s): DBS therapy is an effective treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. It could significantly reduce the frequency of attacks, or even completely control the attack, and improve the patients' quality of life.Copyright © 2015 by the Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Neurology and Neurosurgery.",0,,,
10,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which patients have recurrent seizures. Seizures occur in conjunction with abnormal electrical brain activity which can be recorded by the electroencephalogram (EEG). Often, this abnormal brain activity consists of high amplitude regular spike-wave oscillations as opposed to low amplitude irregular oscillations in the non seizure state. Active brain stimulation has been proposed as a method to terminate seizures prematurely, however, a general and widely-applicable approach to optimal stimulation protocols is still lacking. In this study we use a computational model of epileptic spike-wave dynamics to evaluate the effectiveness of a pseudospectral method to simulated seizure abatement. We incorporate brain connectivity derived from magnetic resonance imaging of a subject with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. We find that the pseudospectral method can successfully generate time-varying stimuli that abate simulated seizures, even when including heterogeneous patient specific brain connectivity. The strength of the stimulus required varies in different brain areas. Our results suggest that seizure abatement, modeled as an optimal control problem and solved with the pseudospectral method, offers an attractive approach to treatment for in vivo stimulation techniques. Further, if optimal brain stimulation protocols are to be experimentally successful, then the heterogeneity of cortical connectivity should be accounted for in the development of those protocols and thus more spatially localized solutions may be preferable.Copyright © 2015 Taylor, Thomas, Sinha, Dauwels, Kaiser, Thesen and Ruths.",1,,,
11,"Neuromodulative treatment options are warranted in patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsy. However, acquisition of controlled data on deep brain stimulation has so far been achieved only for the centromedian and anterior thalamic nucleus. In a case series of four patients with intractable partial epilepsy, a randomized controlled cross-over protocol was used to get insight into efficacy and safety of 3-month nucleus accumbens stimulation. Seizure frequency, neurocognitive testing, ""Liverpool Seizure Severity Score,"" ""Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory,"" ""Beck Depression Inventory,"" and ""Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview"" were obtained at every visit. In a subsequent open-label phase, nucleus accumbens stimulation responders underwent concomitant anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation, whereas nonresponders received solely thalamic stimulation. Under nucleus accumbens stimulation, three of four patients had >=50% reduction in frequency of disabling seizures without further improvement with additional anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation. Patient-reported outcome and neurocognitive testing remained unchanged. Accumbens stimulation is safe and seems to be a suitable option in intractable partial epilepsy. The current findings require substantiation by an adequately powered multicenter study.Copyright © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2015 International League Against Epilepsy.",4,,,
12,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) has been suggested as novel treatment option in refractory focal epilepsy. However, the most optimal target for stimulation has not been described in detail. In the present study, we aimed to study the correlation between stimulation site and outcome in order to define the most optimal target for DBS in refractory epilepsy. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 62 contact locations used in 28 treatment attempts in 15 prospectively followed patients with ANTDBS during past 4,5 years were studied. Treatment attempts were classified into responding and non-responding trials using seizure reduction and side effect profile as criteria. The locations of active contacts in each treatment trial were analyzed indirectly using ACPC coordinate system and stereotactic atlas as well as directly using 3T MRI STIR images. Result(s): The contacts in successful treatment trials were located significantly more anterior (3,4mm vs. 1,4 mm ;p <0,001 ) and superior (12,2mm vs. 10,1mm; p < 0,001) in AC-PC coordinate system compared to contacts in non-responding treatment trials. Contacts at area correlating with most frequently overlapped area of ANT models in 3T MRI STIR images were associated with favourable outcome whereas contacts at area suggested by stereotactic atlas were associated with poor outcome. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrates that stimulation site at the anterior aspect of ANT is crucial for favourable therapy outcome. Direct targeting of ANT is superior to indirect targeting method due to high degree of anatomical variation between individuals, and especially, deviation of patient imaging data from stereotactic atlas. Special attention should be paid on selecting contacts properly at ANT for chronic stimulation while avoiding selection of too deep contacts.",15,,,
13,"Introduction: The neural plasticity is one main mechanism to support the flexibility of human brain. In this talk, I summarize a newly developed method (quadripulse stimulation (QPS)) to induce neural plasticity in human brain, and show a few results in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and myoclonic epilepsy (ME). What's QPS: QPS is one of LTP/LTD like effect inducing stimulation methods. QPS over M1 modulates the stimulated M1 (homotopic plasticity) bidirectionally depending on the interval of magnetic pulses in one burst. Short interval QPS potentiates the excitability and longer interval QPS depresses the target area. QPS at interval of 5ms (QPS5) induces LTP most efficiently and QPS50 LTD most effectively. It also modulates the sensory cortical excitability studied by SEP bidirectionally (heterotopic plasticity); namely QPS5 over M1 potentiates SEP and QPS50 over M1 depresses SEP. QPS effects in myoclonic epilepsy patients (ME): QPS5 over M1 potentiated giant SEP in patients with ME. QPS50 over M1, inducing LTD in normal subjects, also potentiated giant SEP. Some animal experiment suggests that intracellular calcium influx induces the plasticity and AMPA receptor trafficking, internalization, externalization determines the direction of plasticity. Some dysfunction of AMPA receptor may explain the unidirectional plasticity seen in patients with ME. Dopamine and QPS: Taking one tablet of L-Dopa before QPS enhanced both LTP and LTD like effects in normal subjects, which are compatible with dopamine influence on the plasticity in animals. D1 enhanced LTP, and D1 and D2 enhanced LTD. QPS and PD: QPS induced neither LTP nor LTD in PD at off state, but L-dopa normalized the bidirectional plasticity in PD without dyskinesia at on state. In patients with on-dyskinesia, QPS5 potentiated M1, but QPS50 induced neither LTD nor LTP. This is consistent with some animal experimental results.",0,,,
14,"Rationale: For medically refractory focal epilepsy, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) has become an established therapeutic strategy in Europe. Also, DBS of the Ncl. accumbens (NAC) has been shown to be safe and potentially efficacious (Schmitt and Voges et al. Journal of Neurology 2014). However, little is known about the electrophysiological consequences of DBS for both targets, partly because of the lack of appropriate data aquisation. Method(s): We had the opportunity to analyze frequency and location of interictal discharges of five patients treated with NAC-DBS and subsequently three patients with NAC-DBS and NAC-ANT-DBS during a seven day period of long-term monitoring video-eeg-monitoring. These results were compared to baseline before DBS initiation and to seizure outcome after 6 months of chronic DBS. Result(s): Reduction in IEDs frequency was not significant and did not correlate with a seizure reduction in 6-months period (defined as 50% seizure reduction compared with 3-month-baseline period). In two patients (both non-responders in 6-month period) showed a change in IED localisation: one patient with frontal lobe epilepsy had a relative increase in temporal IEDs after ANT-DBS and one patient with temporal lobe epilepsy a relative increase in right temporal IEDs after NAC-DBS. During ANT-NAC-DBS there was no change in IED frequency, IED localisation or 6-month period seizure outcome compared to baseline, NAC-DBS or ANT-DBS. Conclusion(s): DBS changes the irritative zone independent from the location of the epileptogenic zone and of response to this treatment modality. ANT-DBS does not add additional benefit to NAC-DBS responders. Further analysis with higher number of patients are necessary to support these preliminary findings.",5,,,
15,"SIGFRIED (SIGnal modeling For Real-time Identification and Event Detection) software provides real-time functional mapping (RTFM) of eloquent cortex for epilepsy patients preparing to undergo resective surgery. This study presents the first application of paradigms used in functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and electrical cortical stimulation mapping (ESM) studies for shared functional cortical mapping in the context of RTFM. Results from the 3 modalities are compared. A left-handed 13-year-old male with intractable epilepsy participated in functional mapping for localization of eloquent language cortex with fMRI, ESM, and RTFM. For RTFM, data were acquired over the frontal and temporal cortex. Several paradigms were sequentially presented: passive (listening to stories) and active (picture naming and verb generation). For verb generation and story processing, fMRI showed atypical right lateralizing language activation within temporal lobe regions of interest and bilateral frontal activation with slight right lateralization. Left hemisphere ESM demonstrated no eloquent language areas. RTFM procedures using story processing and picture naming elicited activity in the right lateral and basal temporal regions. Verb generation elicited strong right lateral temporal lobe activation, as well as left frontal lobe activation. RTFM results confirmed atypical language lateralization evident from fMRI and ESM. We demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of a new RTFM stimulation paradigm during presurgical evaluation. Block design paradigms used in fMRI may be optimal for this purpose. Further development is needed to create age-appropriate RTFM test batteries.Copyright © 2013 EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS).",0,,,
16,"Objective To demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of responsive stimulation at the seizure focus as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the frequency of seizures in adults with medically intractable partial onset seizures arising from one or two seizure foci. Methods Randomized multicenter double-blinded controlled trial of responsive focal cortical stimulation (RNS System). Subjects with medically intractable partial onset seizures from one or two foci were implanted, and 1 month postimplant were randomized 1:1 to active or sham stimulation. After the fifth postimplant month, all subjects received responsive stimulation in an open label period (OLP) to complete 2 years of postimplant follow-up. Results All 191 subjects were randomized. The percent change in seizures at the end of the blinded period was -37.9% in the active and -17.3% in the sham stimulation group (p = 0.012, Generalized Estimating Equations). The median percent reduction in seizures in the OLP was 44% at 1 year and 53% at 2 years, which represents a progressive and significant improvement with time (p < 0.0001). The serious adverse event rate was not different between subjects receiving active and sham stimulation. Adverse events were consistent with the known risks of an implanted medical device, seizures, and of other epilepsy treatments. There were no adverse effects on neuropsychological function or mood. Significance Responsive stimulation to the seizure focus reduced the frequency of partial-onset seizures acutely, showed improving seizure reduction over time, was well tolerated, and was acceptably safe.

17,"Patients with medically intractable epilepsy often undergo invasive evaluation and surgery, with a 50% success rate. The low success rate is likely due to poor identification of the epileptogenic zone (EZ), the brain area causing seizures. This work introduces a new method using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous direct electrical stimulation of the brain that could help localize the EZ, performed in five patients with medically intractable epilepsy undergoing invasive evaluation with intracranial depth electrodes. Stimulation occurred in a location near the hypothesized EZ and a location away. Electrical recordings in response to stimulation were recorded and compared to fMRI. Multiple stimulation parameters were varied, like current and frequency. The brain areas showing fMRI response were compared with the areas resected and the success of surgery. Robust fMRI maps of activation networks were easily produced, which also showed a significant but weak positive correlation between quantitative measures of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity and measures of electrical activity in response to direct electrical stimulation (mean correlation coefficient of 0.38 for all acquisitions that produced a strong BOLD response). For four patients with outcome data at 6 months, successful surgical outcome is consistent with the resection of brain areas containing high local fMRI activity. In conclusion, this method demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous direct electrical stimulation and fMRI in humans, which allows the study of brain connectivity with high resolution and full spatial coverage. This innovative technique could be used to better define the localization and extension of the EZ in intractable epilepsies, as well as for other functional neurosurgical procedures. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",5,,,
18,"We report on the clinical efficacy of bilateral globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation in two patients with myoclonus dystonia/essential myoclonus who lack mutations in the epsilon sarcoglycan gene. The primary outcome measures were the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Scale motor severity and the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale scores, and the secondary outcome measure was the 36-item Short Form Health Survey score at the last postoperative follow up. Neuronal firing rates were also calculated from microelectrode recordings. At the last postoperative follow-up (16 weeks for Patient 1 and 18 weeks for Patient 2), there was 57.1% (Patient 1) improvement in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Scale motor severity score and 31.3% (Patient 1) and 69% (Patient 2) in the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale score while individual SF-36 scores showed improvement in most subdomains. Bilateral globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation can be effective in ameliorating epsilon sarcoglycan negative myoclonus with or without concurrent dystonia. Whether an epsilon sarcoglycan negative status represents a less favorable prognostic factor for pallidal deep brain stimulation remains to be elucidated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2,,,
19,"About one third of patients with epilepsy are refractory to medical treatment. For these patients, alternative treatment options include implantable neurostimulation devices such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and responsive neuro-stimulation systems (RNS). We conducted a systematic literature review to assess the available evidence on the clinical efficacy of these devices in patients with refractory epilepsy across their lifespan. VNS has the largest evidence base, and numerous randomized controlled trials and open-label studies support its use in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1997 for treatment of partial seizures, but has also shown significant benefit in the treatment of generalized seizures. Results in adult populations have been more encouraging than in pediatric populations, where more studies are required. VNS is considered a safe and well-tolerated treatment, and serious side effects are rare. DBS is a well-established treatment for several movement disorders, and has a small evidence base for treatment of refractory epilepsy. Stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus has shown the most encouraging results, where significant decreases in seizure frequency were reported. Other potential targets include the centromedian thalamic nucleus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia structures. Preliminary results on RNS, new-generation implantable neuro-stimulation devices which stimulate brain structures only when epileptic activity is detected, are encouraging. Overall, implantable neurostimulation devices appear to be a safe and beneficial treatment option for patients in whom medical treatment has failed to adequately control their epilepsy. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials are required to provide a sufficient evidence base for the inclusion of DBS and RNS in clinical guidelines.Copyright © 2014 Cox et al.",0,,,
20,"Background: Several surgical adverse events (SAEs) have been associated with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, leading to certain confusion about the risk/benefit ratio of this technique, and giving rise to the need of more and more extensive control studies over longer periods. The aim of this article is to identify and quantify the factors associated with the most frequent AEs from STN DBS in PD-diagnosed patients. Method(s): The following variables were studied: aborted procedure, misplaced leads, intracranial haemorrhage, and seizures. This study was carried out in 233 patients diagnosed with PD, with 455 STN electrodes implanted and follow-up after 7 (8-14) years follow up. Result(s): A total amount of 56 SAEs occurred in 49 patients (11.76 % of total procedures, 12.31 % of implanted leads, 21.03 % of patients). SAEs were: five aborted procedures, 26 misplaced leads, ten intracranial haemorrhages, and 15 seizures. Of all the SAEs, long-term effects only happened in two cases of hemiparesis caused by intracranial haemorrhage; the other SAEs were reversible and didn't leave any long-term clinical consequences (0.42 % of procedures, 0.44 % of leads, and 0.86 % of patients). Conclusion(s): STN DBS in PD patients is a safe surgical procedure, with good risk/benefit ratios: procedure reliability/correct lead implantation in 95.59 %, 0 mortality/implanted lead, 0.12 morbidity/implanted lead, and 0.0043 neurological sequelae/implanted lead. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",233,,,
21,"Objective: Extraoperative cortical stimulation (CS) for mapping of eloquent cortex in patients prior to epilepsy surgery is not standardized across centres. Two different techniques are in use, referred to as bipolar and monopolar CS. We compared the ability of bipolar versus monopolar CS to identify eloquent cortex and their safety profile in patients undergoing subdural EEG recordings. Method(s): Five patients undergoing intracranial EEG recordings and extraoperative CS. Systematic comparison of stimulus parameters, clinical signs and afterdischarges of bipolar versus monopolar CS. Result(s): Bipolar CS requires less stimulation current but is more time consuming and more likely to produce afterdischarges when compared to monopolar CS. None of the stimulations elicited seizures. The area defined as eloquent by either bipolar or monopolar CS reveals only minor discordances, involving mainly the outer row and edge of the electrode array producing clinical signs with monopolar CS only. Qualitatively, bi- and monopolar CS reproduced similar movements and types of muscle contractions. Conclusion(s): Bipolar and monopolar CS are safe procedures identifying similar cortical areas as eloquent, although monopolar cortical stimulation is less time consuming. Significance: Findings advocate the use of monopolar CS in a clinical setting. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",5,,,
22,"Medically refractory epilepsy remains a major medical problem worldwide. Although some patients are eligible for surgical resection of seizure foci, a proportion of patients are ineligible for a variety of reasons. One such reason is that the foci reside in eloquent cortex of the brain and therefore resection would result in significant morbidity. This retrospective study reports our experience with a novel neurostimulation technique for the treatment of these patients. We identified three patients who were ineligible for surgical resection of the intracranially identified seizure focus because it resided in eloquent cortex, who underwent therapeutic trial of focal cortical stimulation delivered through the subdural monitoring grid. All three patients had a significant reduction in seizures, and two went on to permanent implantation, which resulted in long-term reduction in seizure frequency. In conclusion, this small case report provides some evidence of proof of concept of the role of targeted continuous neocortical neurostimulation in the treatment of medically refractory focal epilepsy, and provides support for ongoing investigations into this treatment modality.

23,"Methods: We analyzed seizures acutely induced by pharmacological manipulations (bicuculline and 4-aminopyridine) in the entorhinal cortex and in the hippocampus of the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain.
Results: As seizures ended, extracellular and intracellular recordings showed periodic bursting that progressively decreased in frequency. During the late bursting phase, the duration, number, and rate of occurrence of spikes within single bursts remained constant, whereas cumulative spike amplitude (index of excitation during a burst) and interburst interval (index of inhibition between bursts) progressively increased. The increment of average/cumulative burst excitation and interburst interval toward seizure end was confirmed in human focal seizures recorded with intracerebral electrodes in patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsies. A postburst refractory period of circa 2 seconds that increases with time toward the end of the seizure was confirmed in the experimental model by probing interburst epochs in the CA1 region with local dentate gyrus stimulation just suprathreshold for burst generation.
Interpretation: Our findings support the concept that focal seizures are terminated by the simultaneous and opposing enhancement of excitation (burst activity) in addition to postburst inhibition. We hypothesize that a seizure stops when postburst inhibition becomes large enough to prevent reactivation of excitation
Objective: Comprehension of the events that lead to seizure termination contributes to the development of strategies to confine propagation of ictal discharges. It is commonly assumed that the inhibitory control fails during seizures and recovers after the end of the ictal event. We examine the possibility that a progressive increase of inhibition that counters an increase in the strength of excitation contributes to terminating a focal seizure.Copyright © 2014 American Neurological Association.",0,,,
24,"Despite medications, resective surgery, and vagal nerve stimulation, some patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures. In these patients, other approaches are urgently needed. The biological basis of stimulation of anterior thalamic nucleus and epileptogenic focus is presented. Results from two large randomized controlled trials Stimulation of Anterior Nucleus of Thalamus for Epilepsy (SANTE) and Neuropace pivotal trial are discussed. Neuromodulation provides effective treatment for a select group of refractory epilepsy patients. Future investigations into the mechanism underlying 'response' to brain stimulation are desired.",0,,,
25,"Background Deep brain stimulation, specifically high-frequency stimulation (HFS), is an alternative and promising treatment for intractable epilepsies; however, the optimal targets are still unknown. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) occupies a key position in the modulation of the cortico-thalamic and thalamo-cortical pathways. Objective We determined the efficacy of HFS in the TRN against tonic-clonic generalized seizures (TCGS) and status epilepticus (SE), which were induced by scheduled pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injections. Methods Male Wistar rats were stereotactically implanted and assigned to three experimental groups: Control group, which received only PTZ injections; HFS-TRN group, which received HFS in the left TRN prior to PTZ injections; and HFS-Adj group, which received HFS in the left adjacent nuclei prior to PTZ injections. Results The HFS-TRN group reported a significant increase in the latency for development of TCGS and SE compared with the HFS-Adj and Control groups (P < 0.009). The number of PTZ-doses required for SE was also significantly increased (P < 0.001). Spectral analysis revealed a significant decrease in the frequency band from 0.5 Hz to 4.5 Hz of the left motor cortex in the HFS-TRN and HFS-Adj groups, compared to the Control group. Conversely, HFS-TRN provoked a significant increase in all frequency bands in the TRN. EEG asynchrony was observed during spike-wave discharges by HFS-TRN. Conclusion These data indicate that HFS-TRN has an anti-epileptogenic effect and is able to modify seizure synchrony and interrupt abnormal EEG recruitment of thalamo-cortical and, indirectly, cortico-thalamic pathways. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

26,"Purpose: To examine the effects of current shunt on rats with temporal lobe epilepsy and neocortex epilepsy. Experimental Design: A kainic acid (KA)-induced model of temporal lobe seizure and a penicillin-induced model of neocortical partial seizure were used in this study. Rats of each model were randomly allocated into two groups: control and model groups. The model group was further divided into the KA or penicillin group, sham conduction group and conduction group. The current shunt was realized through the implantation of a customized conduction electrode. After surgery, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for two hours for each rat under anesthesia. Subsequently, the rats were video monitored for 72 h to detect the occurrence of behavioral seizures upon awakening. The average number and duration of seizures on EEG and the number of behavioral seizures were measured. Result(s): In KA model, the number of total EEG seizures in conduction group (9.5+/-2.46) was significantly less than that in sham conduction group (15.13+/-3.45) (p<0.01). The duration of EEG seizures in conduction group (26.13+/-7.81 s) was significantly shorter than that in sham conduction group (34.17+/-7.25 s) (p = 0.001). A significant reduction of behavioral seizures was observed in the conduction group compared with KA (p = 0.000) and sham conduction groups (p = 0.000). In penicillin model, there was a 61% reduction in total EEG seizures in conduction group compared with sham conduction group (p<0.01), and the duration of EEG seizures in conduction group (6.29+/-2.64 s) was significantly shorter than that in the sham conduction group (12.07+/-3.81 s) (p = 0.002). A significant reduction of behavioral seizures was observed in conduction group compared with penicillin (p<0.01) and sham conduction groups (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Current shunt effectively reduces the onset and severity of seizures. Current shunt therapy could be an effective alternative minimally invasive approach for temporal lobe epilepsy and neocortex epilepsy. © 2014 Zhang et al.",0,,,
27,"Background. The study on stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for epilepsy (SANTE) is so far the only clinical trial to provide class I evidence for the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in partial epilepsy. Stratification of possible responders and potential contraindications are still lacking. Aim. The rationale and the design of a double-blind and an open interventional study protocol for the nucleus accumbens (NAC) as a potential target for DBS in epilepsy are introduced in this article. Material and methods. In both investigation protocols potential psychiatric alterations were collated using the Beck depression inventory (BDI) and the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) as well as cognitive alterations using an extensive epilepsy-specific neurocognitive examination. Additionally the Liverpool seizure severity scale (LSSS) was used to objectify possible alterations in the severity of seizures. Determination of the quality of life was carried out using the quality of life inventory for epilepsy P-31. The patients completed a seizure calendar in which a differentiation was made and documented between simple focal, complex focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The anti-ictal medication for all patients treated with DBS was left unaltered during the investigation period. The minimum requirement for admission to the 6-month interventional study investigation protocol was a seizure frequency of at least one debilitating seizure per month. The randomized controlled investigation protocol had a shorter observation period of only 3 months and required a minimum of three debilitating seizures per month. Results. For the four patients who have so far been recruited into the interventional study protocol there was a tendency towards a reduction of the subjective severity of seizures after 6 months of NAC-DBS (p=0.068). Seizure frequency as well as psychiatric and neurocognitive outcome parameters remained unchanged. Conclusion. These preliminary results suggest that the NAC might represent a suitable target for DBS in partial epilepsy in syndrome-oriented indications for focal epilepsy; however, the small patient numbers and the open design of this protocol warrant higher evidence class studies to confirm the results and identify possible responders and side effects. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",4,,,
28,"Background. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of refractory epilepsy has officially been approved in Europe since 2010. It is still a matter of debate which forms of focal epilepsy can be treated with DBS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT). Aim. The aim of this study was to use diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography (DTI-FT) to research connectivity of the ANT and adjacent nuclei to other brain regions in patients with implants. Material and methods. A series of eight consecutive patients were treated with ANT DBS after undergoing DTI-FT (3 T and 32 or 61 gradient directions). The ANT DBS was performed stereotactically via a transventricular route and postoperatively, electrode positions were determined with helical computed tomography. The individual contacts of these quadripolar DBS electrodes served as seed regions and tractography was performed from the vicinity of every contact (StealthViz-DTI, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Fiber tracts were spatially mapped and transferred to the ICBM-152 standard brain. Results. More superficially located DBS electrode contacts (located in the ANT or proximity) affected fiber tracts that projected to the temporal or frontal regions. Fiber tracts located deeper projected to the brain stem and from here to the periaqueductal gray matter or the prefrontal cortex. Conclusion. A clinical evaluation is currently not available for implanted patients. The connectivity analysis, however, helps to draw conclusions concerning a possibly improved patient selection for ANT DBS. According to these results, frontal and temporal epilepsies should show a better outcome than other focal epilepsies and under the assumption of direct modulation or recruitable modulated effects an increase of psychiatric complications (e.g. depression) might be expected from the stimulation of deeper electrode contacts. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",8,,,
29,"Low-frequency stimulation (LFS) is emerging as a new option for the treatment of epilepsy. The present study was designed to determine whether there is a crucial period for the treatment of epileptogenesis with LFS. LFS was delivered at different time-points to evaluate its anti-epileptogenic effect on amygdala-kindling rats. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose small-animal positron-emission tomography (microPET) and multi-channel EEG recording (MER) were used to investigate the dynamics of brain networks during epileptogenesis and LFS treatment. Interestingly, LFS delivered in the first 7 days significantly retarded the progression of behavioral seizure stages and shortened the afterdischarge duration (ADD), LFS delivered throughout the whole process resulted in similar effects. However, if LFS was delivered at the beginning of seizure stage 2 or 3 (5 +/- 0.3 days during kindling acquisition), it had no anti-epileptogenic effect and even prolonged the ADD and enhanced synchronization of the EEGs. MicroPET study revealed a notable hypometabolism in the amygdala, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex and other regions in the limbic system during the period from seizure stage 0 to stage 2 or 3. The glucose metabolism in those regions was specifically increased by LFS. MER further verified that an early network of afterdischarge spread was formed in those brain regions during kindling acquisition. Thus, we provided direct evidence that modulation of the early network in the limbic system is crucial for the anti-epileptogenic effect of LFS in amygdaloid-kindling rats. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",0,,,
30,"Introduction: Deep brain stimulation has developed to established treatment modality for difficult-totreat pharmacoresistant epilepsies. However stimulation of the anterior thalamus is associated with increased complaints of memory impairment and depression. First results are presented, which assess efficacy and safety of chronic electrical stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) - a putative new target for patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. Method(s): Following a 3-month baseline period, all subjects (5 patients) underwent bilateral NAC stimulation for 6 months. Antiepileptic drugs remained unchanged throughout the study. Outcomes of interest were changes in median frequency of disabling seizures (sum of complex partial and generalized tonic clonic seizures) and proportion of responders (>= 50 % reduction of seizure frequency), also patient outcome questionnaires (Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale [LSSS], Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire [QOLIE-31-P] and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-IA]), psychiatric assessment by Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and extensive neuropsychological testing were assessed prior to electrode implantation and after 6 months of NAC stimulation. Result(s): Two out of five participants were responders. The median reduction in frequency of disabling seizures was 37.5%. NAC stimulation resulted in significant decrease in seizure severity as assessed with LSSS (p = 0.043). QOLIE-31-P total score trended towards improvement (p = 0.068), whereas BDI IA-scores, M.I.N.I. and neuropsychological test scores remained unchanged. Conclusion(s): In patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy, chronic electrical stimulation of the NAC may be effective as indicated by median reduction in seizure frequency and decreased seizure severity. NAC stimulation leaves neurocognitive function and psychiatric comorbidity unchanged.",5,,,
31,"Objective: Quadripulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (QPS) applied over primary motor cortex (M1) induces powerful bidirectional long-lasting effects on somatosensory cortex (S1) as well as M1. The purpose of this study is to investigate QPS effects on S1 in myoclonus epilepsy (ME) patients. Method(s): Eleven normal volunteers and 6 ME-patients participated in this study. QPS was applied with different interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 5, 30, 50, 100, 500 and 1250 ms on the left M1 for 30 minutes. We measured the N20 to P25 (N20p-P25) and P25 to N33 (P25-N33) amplitudes of the ipsilateral median nerve somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), and compared their time courses between normal subjects and the patients. Result(s): In normal subjects, the P25-N33 amplitude was enhanced by QPS-5 (ISI =5 ms) and suppressed by QPS-50 (ISI =50 ms), QPS-100 (ISI =100 ms), QPS-500 (ISI =500 ms) and QPS-1250 (ISI =1250 ms). QPS-30 (ISI =30 ms) and sham stimulation showed no significant effects upon it. The N20p-P25 amplitude was not affected by any QPSs. In ME-patients, in contrast, the P25-N33 amplitude was enhanced by QPS-5, QPS-30, QPS-50 and QPS-100, but not affected by either QPS-500 or QPS-1250. Furthermore, N20p-P25 amplitude was also enlarged by QPS-5, QPS-30 and QPS-50, but not altered by QPS-100, QPS-500 and QPS-1250. Conclusion(s): In normal subjects, QPS on M1 with different ISIs showed bidirectional effects on S1, which was compatible with the Bienenstock- Cooper-Munro curve. On the contrary, in ME- patients, the QPS on M1 unidirectionally potentiated S1, which suggested heterotopic hyper-excitable connection between M1 and S1.",6,,,
32,Purpose: To test the efficacy of deep brain stimulation in focal onset intractable epilepsy in clinical setting. Method(s): We performed bilateral anterior thalamic Deep brain stimulation surgery in 5 patients with intractable focal onset epilepsy who were not candidates for resective surgery. Result(s): The median age was 27 years with epilepsy duration of 17 years with seizure frequency ranging from 7/month to 60/month. All of the n five patients had intractable complex partial epilepsy without clear EEG localization or localized lesions on MRI and had been evaluated and refused resective surgery earlier. All patients have more than 6 months of follow up. Of the five patients two patients became seizure free in over 6 months of follow up one patient has occassional seizures and two had 60% seizure reduction. All patients achieved more than 50% seizure reduction with mean 90 seizure reduction and 40% became seizure free. Conclusion(s): Deep Brain stimulation is an effective treatment for intractable partial onset epilepsy and represents a significant advance for patients who are not candidates for resective surgery.,5,,,
33,"Rationale: Complex partial seizures can cause loss of consciousness to devastating effect. Patients with surgically refractory epilepsy have 319 no clinical option to prevent loss of consciousness during seizures. Human patients with complex partial seizures have ictal neocortical slow oscillations during impaired consciousness. We have previously developed a rodent model of complex partial limbic seizures, which mimics the human EEG. In our rodent model, the brainstem cholinergic system is suppressed and the intralaminar thalamic nuclei are disrupted. There are previous reports that stimulation of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei has restored consciousness to patients in minimally conscious state. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of stimulating the intralaminar thalamic nuclei in our rodent model of complex partial seizures with the goal of restoring consciousness. Method(s): To optimize our stimulation paradigm and determine the downstream effects of stimulation, we stimulated the intralaminar centrolateral nucleus under anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine 90/15 mg/kg) while recording blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. BOLD fMRI images were recorded at 9.4 T. Next, we recorded local field potential and multiunit activity in the orbital frontal cortex while stimulating the thalamus under anesthesia in order to convert anesthesia-induced slow oscillations into normal cortical activity. Finally we stimulated the thalamus during limbic seizures in order to convert ictal neocortical slow oscillations to normal cortical activity. Seizures were induced by a 2-second, 60 Hz electrical stimulus in the dorsal hippocampus. In each experiment, the thalamic stimulation parameters were a 2 second stimulus of 100 Hz. Stimulus amplitude varied (0.2-2mA). Result(s): We observed BOLD fMRI increases during thalamic stimulation under anesthesia in the thalamus, cingulate, and frontal cortex, the same regions which show BOLD decreases during limbic seizures. Cortical electrophysiological recordings during intralaminar thalamic stimulation under anesthesia revealed conversion of cortical low-frequency slow oscillations to high-frequency fast activity which persisted for several seconds after stimulation. Finally, we stimulated the intralaminar nuclei during limbic seizures and converted ictal neocortical slow waves as well as post-ictal slow waves into normal fast activity. Conclusion(s): Thalamic stimulation to restore consciousness during complex partial is a novel therapeutic approach to improving the lives of patients suffering from surgically-refractory epilepsy. In the future, we will extend our studies to awake recordings, with a goal of restoring both normal electrophysiological activity as well as normal behavior. If thalamic stimulation prevents loss of consciousness in an animal model, we hope to extend our studies to human therapeutic trials.",0,,,2.0
34,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive technique that enables the stimulation of the brain tissue, has been used not only in neurophysiological research aimed at localizing cortical functions but also in the treatment of nervous disorders. It includes administration of single or repetitive magnetive pulses of adjustable intensity and frequency to a certain part of the nervous system. Depression is the leading illness on which the most robust data have been increasingly collected since the introduction of TMS into clinical use in 1985. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that TMS is effective in the treatment of depression. TMS has also been used in depressive patients resistant to pharmachological intervention and found to have higher efficacy compared with sham TMS. Although various parts of the both hemispheres have been stimulated by employing different parameters, 90 percent of depressive patients included in clinical studies have received repetitive stimulations of high frequency to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It has been reported that the most serious side effect of repetitive and high-frequency TMS is the occurence of seizures. We present a case who had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure during TMS treatment and literature on TMS-induced seizure is reviewed.",0,,,
35,"Seizure control using deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides an alternative therapy to patients with intractable and drug resistant epilepsy. This paper presents novel DBS stimulus protocols to disrupt seizures. Two protocols are presented: open-loop stimulation and a closed-loop feedback system utilizing measured ring rates to adjust stimulus frequency. Stimulation suppression is demonstrated in a computational model using 3000 excitatory Morris-Lecar (M-L) model neurons connected with depressing synapses. Cells are connected using second order network topology (SONET) to simulate network topologies measured in cortical networks. The network spontaneously switches from tonic to clonic as synaptic strengths and tonic input to the neurons decreases. To this model we add periodic stimulation pulses to simulate DBS. Periodic forcing can synchronize or desynchronize an oscillating population of neurons, depending on the stimulus frequency and amplitude. Therefore, it is possible to either extend or truncate the tonic or clonic phases of the seizure. Stimuli applied at the ring rate of the neuron generally synchronize the population while stimuli slightly slower than the ring rate prevent synchronization. We present an adaptive stimulation algorithm that measures the ring rate of a neuron and adjusts the stimulus to maintain a relative stimulus frequency to ring frequency and demonstrate it in a computational model of a tonic-clonic seizure. This adaptive algorithm can affect the duration of the tonic phase using much smaller stimulus amplitudes than the open-loop control. © 2013 Beverlin and Netoff.",0,,,
36,"Objective Surgical resection of the temporal lobe is an effective treatment for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, but can cause memory impairment. Deep brain stimulation in epilepsy has targeted gray matter structures using high frequencies, but achieved limited success. We tested the hypothesis that low-frequency stimulation of the fornix reduces interictal epileptiform discharges and seizures in patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, without affecting memory. Methods We implanted depth electrodes in 11 patients for surgical evaluation of intractable epilepsy. Low-frequency stimulation of the fornix occurred in 4-hour sessions in the video-electroencephalography unit. Mental status assessment was performed at baseline and during stimulation. We studied the effect of stimulation on hippocampal spikes and seizures. Results There were no complications, and the patients were unaware of the stimulation. Fornix stimulation elicited evoked responses in the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate gyrus. Hourly Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores showed an increase during stimulation when compared to prestimulation MMSE, largely due to improvement in recall, possibly representing a practice effect. Hippocampal spikes were significantly reduced during and outlasting each stimulation session. Seizure odds (n = 7) were reduced by 92% in the 2 days that followed stimulation. Interpretation Low-frequency stimulation of the fornix activates the hippocampus and other areas of the declarative memory circuit. The results of this preliminary study suggest that low-frequency stimulation is tolerable and reduces epileptiform discharges and seizures in patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. A controlled clinical trial may be warranted. © 2013 American Neurological Association.",11,,,
37,"Objective The purpose of this study was to improve the surgical treatment of epilepsy by maximising seizure control while protecting language function. Methods A combined process of extra-operative electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) mapping, direct ECS and intra-operative continuous language assessment was performed during complicated operative cases. Of the 24 epilepsy patients, nine had a complex relationship between the seizure onset zone and the language cortices. The combined process was used in these nine patients. In the other 15 patients, surgical resection was completed based on extra-operative ECS results alone. Evaluations were performed before and after surgery to assess language function and seizure control. Results The intra-operative continuous language assessment provided important information at the time of the resection. Seven extra-operative ECS positive language sites were resected without obvious language deficits in two patients. Resection was interrupted by language disturbances in an area where no extra-operative ECS positive site was identified in one patient. In three other patients, functional boundary was undefined in extra-operative ECS result, epileptogenic cortices were maximally resected during the continuous language assessment. In terms of seizure control, 18 of 24 (75%) patients reached Engel's class I, including all nine patients who underwent intra-operative continuous language assessment. One patient had minor surgery-related language deficits three months after resection. Conclusions Intra-operative continuous language assessment proved to be complementary to extra-operative ECS mappings. The combination of ECS mappings and intra-operative continuous language assessment can maximise the resection of epileptogenic cortices and preserve language function in difficult cases involving the language cortex. © 2013 British Epilepsy Association.",24,,,
38,"Summary Purpose Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus is an emerging surgical option for people with medically refractory epilepsy that is not suitable for resective surgery, or in whom surgery has failed. Our main aim was to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral centromedian thalamic nucleus (CMN) DBS for seizure control in generalized epilepsy and frontal lobe epilepsy with a two-center, single-blind, controlled trial. Methods Participants were adults with refractory generalized or frontal lobe epilepsy. Seizure diaries were kept by patients/carers prospectively from enrollment. The baseline preimplantation period was followed by a control period consisting of a blind stimulation-OFF phase of at least 3 months, a 3-month blind stimulation-ON phase, and a 6-month unblinded stimulation-ON phase. The control period was followed by an unblinded long-term extension phase with stimulation-ON in those patients in whom stimulation was thought to be effective. Key Findings Eleven patients were recruited at King's College Hospital (London, United Kingdom United Kingdom) and at University Hospital La Princesa (Madrid, Spain). Among the five patients with frontal lobe epilepsy, only one patient had >50% improvement in seizure frequency during the blind period. In the long-term extension phase, two patients with frontal lobe epilepsy had >50% improvement in seizure frequency. All six patients with generalized epilepsy had >50% improvement in seizure frequency during the blind period. In the long-term extension phase, five of the six patients showed >50% improvement in the frequency of major seizures (one became seizure free, one had >99% improvement, and three had 60-95% reduction in seizure frequency). Among patients with generalized epilepsy, the DBS implantation itself appears to be effective, as two patients remained seizure free during 12 and 50 months with DBS OFF, and the remaining four had 50-91% improvement in the initial 3 months with DBS OFF. Significance DBS implantation and stimulation of the CMN appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment, particularly in patients with refractory generalized epilepsy. CMN stimulation was not as effective in frontal lobe epilepsy, which requires further studies. DBS of the CMN should be considered as a treatment option, particularly in patients with refractory generalized epilepsy syndromes. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2013 International League Against Epilepsy.",6,,,
39,"Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is increasingly used for non-invasive functional mapping in preoperative evaluation for brain surgery, and the reliability of navigated TMS (nTMS) motor representation maps has been studied in the healthy population and in brain tumor patients. The lesions behind intractable epilepsy differ from typical brain tumors, ranging from developmental cortical malformations to injuries early in development, and may influence the functional organization of the cortical areas. Moreover, the interictal cortical epileptic activity and antiepileptic medication may affect the nTMS motor threshold. The reliability of the nTMS motor representation localization in epilepsy patients has not been addressed. Method(s): We compared the nTMS motor cortical representation maps of hand and arm muscles with the results of invasive electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) in 13 patients with focal epilepsy. The nTMS maps were projected to the cortical surface segmented from preoperative magnetic resonance images (MRI), and the positions of the subdural electrodes were extracted from the postoperative low-dose computed tomography (CT) images registered with preoperative MRI. Result(s): The 3D distance between the average nTMS site and average ECS electrode location was 11 +/- 4 mm for the hand and 16 +/- 7 mm for arm muscle representation areas. In all patients the representation areas defined with nTMS and ECS were located on the same gyrus, also in patients with abundant interictal epileptic activity on the motor gyrus. Conclusion(s): nTMS can reliably locate the hand motor cortical representation area with the accuracy needed for pre-surgical evaluation in patients with epilepsy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",13,,,
40,"Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder, and the most common form of progressive myoclonus epilepsies. Its main symptoms, epileptic seizures and drug-resistant myoclonus, may be associated with neurophysiological evidence of abnormal cortical excitability or reduced inhibition. The aim of the present study was to utilize transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to induce cortical responses measured with electroencephalography (EEG) in order to observe prevailing cortical excitability/inhibition changes, as well as power and coherence of the cortical oscillations in EPM1. We studied 7 genetically verified EPM1 patients (4 female; age 36. +/-. 6 years) and 6 healthy control subjects (1 female; age 34. +/-. 12 years). Navigated TMS was focused on the left primary motor cortex at the representation area of the right thumb. TMS-EEG responses were measured at 90% of the resting motor threshold intensity in 110-150 trials. We observed that P30 waveform following the TMS was significantly (p<0.05) increased in EPM1 patients suggesting increased cortico-cortical excitability, while the later N100/P180 waveform was significantly (p<0.05) decreased indicating reduced inhibition. In the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), we found that alpha, beta and gamma band oscillations following the TMS were significantly lower in power in the EPM1 patients compared to controls. In the alpha and beta bands, the inter-trial coherence (ITC) representing the degree of synchronization was also decreased in EPM1. Our results suggest abnormal reactivity in EPM1, and may indicate impaired cortico-cortical inhibition and attenuation of subsequent cortical circuits or the thalamic or subcortical nuclei. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",7,,,
41,"Background: Transcranial motor evoked potentials are used to detect iatrogenic injury to the corticospinal tracts and vascular territory of the anterior spinal artery. Tongue and lip lacerations are the most common complication of this modality. Theoretical complications include cardiac arrhythmia and seizure although there are no published reports of either. Case Report: We report a case of postoperative seizure following motor evoked potential testing in a patient without a seizure history. Although anecdotal reports exist, ours is the first known published report of seizure following transcranial electrical stimulation. Conclusion(s): The intent of this novel report is to encourage the use of anesthetic regimens that raise seizure threshold, decrease stimulation threshold, and increase the specificity ofmotor evoked potentials. Providers should be prepared to treat intraoperative or perioperative seizure activity when the monitoring protocol includes transcranial motor evoked potentials. © Academic Division of Ochsner Clinic Foundation.",1,,,
42,"Background/Aim: This study aimed to compare the cortical excitability of patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) and that of patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNESs). Method(s): Patients were classified into groups according to their electroencephalogram (EEG) findings and seizure types: group 1 = GTCS with an abnormal EEG, group 2 = GTCS with a normal EEG and group 3 = PNES with a normal EEG. The control group included healthy volunteers with normal EEGs. Cortical silent period (CSP) and motor threshold (MT) were measured for all groups and the results were compared. Result(s): CSPs were significantly prolonged in groups 1 and 2 when compared with group 3 and the control group. No differences were found between the MT measurements of all groups. Conclusion(s): The prolongation of CSP may demonstrate the differences between the pathophysiological mechanisms of GTCS and those of PNES.Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.",0,,,
43,"With an annual incidence of 50/100,000 people, nearly 1% of the population suffers from epilepsy. Treatment with antiepileptic medication fails to achieve seizure remission in 20-30% of patients. One treatment option for refractory epilepsy patients who would not otherwise be surgical candidates is electrical stimulation of the brain, which is a rapidly evolving and reversible adjunctive therapy. Therapeutic stimulation can involve direct stimulation of the brain nuclei or indirect stimulation of peripheral nerves. There are three stimulation modalities that have class I evidence supporting their uses: vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT), and, the most recently developed, responsive neurostimulation (RNS). While the other treatment modalities outlined deliver stimulation regardless of neuronal activity, the RNS administers stimulation only if triggered by seizure activity. The lower doses of stimulation provided by such responsive devices can not only reduce power consumption, but also prevent adverse reactions caused by continuous stimulation, which include the possibility of habituation to long-term stimulation. RNS, as an investigational treatment for medically refractory epilepsy, is currently under review by the FDA. Eventually systems may be developed to enable activation by neurochemical triggers or to wirelessly transmit any information gathered. We review the mechanisms, the current status, the target options, and the prospects of RNS for the treatment of medically intractable epilepsy. © 2013.",0,,,
44,"Background: Over recent years, neuromodulation has been reported to be of value for the treatment of different conditions where the pathophysiologic background is believed to be a central nervous dysfunction. One such entity is epilepsy where positive effects have been reported in adults. In children, the experience is extremely scarce. Given that the technique is non-invasive and that there is no reason to believe that it could be harmful, it seems reasonable to try it at least in severe cases that do not respond to conventional therapy. Method(s): Daily one hour sessions of low frequent repetitive TMS (rTMS, 0.5 Hz) were used to treat two children with severe epilepsy. A two year, eight months old boy with Alper's disease developed epilepsia partialis continuawith rhythmic jerking of the left upper extremity, mainly the hand. Pharmacological therapy was unsuccessful and scalp EEG could not reveal the seizure focus. The hand area of the primary motor cortex was localised using navigated TMS based on the patients structural MR. This position was used for rTMS treatment. A six year, three months old girl developed a CSWS syndrome due to a cortical malformation. After tapering of corticosteroids her seizure situation worsened. Scalp EEG revealed a number of electrical seizure foci. While waiting for a planned neurosurgical treatment, rTMS was used directed by the EEG localisations. Result(s): The treatment sessions were mainly uneventful, in the majority the children slept during the stimulations. (The boy often needed a light procedural sedation though.) During about two weeks of treatment, the number and severity of seizures reported by parents and personnel were reduced for both patients. Conclusion(s): rTMS for the treatment of epilepsy can be performed successfully even in small children. The procedure requires a lot of resources. If tried in less severe cases than the two presented, it may be even more efficient.",0,,,

To evaluate the effi cacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the centromedian thalamic nucleus for seizure control and patient related outcome measures (PROMs) in patients with refractory generalised and frontal lobe epilepsy. Design. A single-blind, controlled trial. Subjects . Nine patients were recruited at King's College Hospital (London, UK). Five patients had refractory generalised epilepsy and four had frontal lobe epilepsy. Method . Th e baseline pre-implantation period was followed by a control period consisting in a blind stimulation-OFF phase of at least three months, a three months blind stimulation- ON phase, and a six months unblind stimulation-ON phase. Th e control period was followed by an unblind longterm extension phase with stimulation-ON. Results . All 5 patients with generalised epilepsy had - 50% improvement in seizure frequency during the blind period. In the long-term extension phase, four out of the fi ve patients showed - 50% improvement in the frequency of major seizures. Among these 4 patients, three became seizure free, and one had 67 - 80% reduction in seizure frequency. Among the 4 patients with frontal lobe epilepsy, only one patient had - 50% improvement in seizure frequency during the blind period. In the long-term extension phase, two frontal patients had - 50% improvement in seizure frequency. Conclusion . Deep brain stimulation of the centromedian thalamic nucleus appears to be a safe and effi cacious treatment, particularly in patients with refractory generalised epilepsy.",9,,,
46,"Rationale: There is currently no resective (potentially curative) surgical option useful in this patient population. Palliative procedures such as callosotomy (Cx), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or deep brain stimulation have been offered. We compared the outcome after Cx or VNS in two consecutive prospective cohorts of patients with secondary generalized epilepsy. Method(s): Twenty patients were submitted to callosotomy from 2006 to 2007 (Group 1); 20 additional patients were submitted to VNS from 2008 to 2009 (Group 2). They had secondary generalized epilepsy of the Lennox-Gastaut or Lennox-like type. They were submitted to a neurological interview and examination, interictal and ictal video-EEG, high resolution 1.5T MRI, and cognitive and quality of life evaluations. Two-year post-operative follow-up results were considered for each patient. Result(s): Final mean stimuli intensity was 3.0mA in Group 2 patients. There were 10% of seizure-free patients in Group 1, and none in Group 2. Ten percent of Group 1 patients were non-responders, while 16% of Group 2 did so. Improvement in attention and quality of life was noted in 85% of both Group 1 and 2 patients. Rupture of secondary bilateral synchrony was noted in 85% of Group 1 patients; there was no EEG modification after VNS in group 2. Both procedures were effective regarding the control of atypical absences and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Both procedures were not effective in controlling tonic seizures. Callosotomy was very effective in reducing atonic seizure's frequency, while VNS was ineffective. On the other hand, callosotomy was not effective in reducing myoclonic seizures, while VNS did so. Conclusion(s): Callosotomy might be preferred as primary treatment in kids with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and no specific findings on MRI if atonic seizures prevail in the patient's clinical picture; when myoclonic seizures prevail this might hold true in favor of VNS. When atypical absence or generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the main concern, although both procedures carry similar effectiveness, VNS should be considered as an initial approach taking into account the adverse event profile. Patients should be advised that both procedures are not very effective in the treatment of tonic seizures.",20,,,3.0
47,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of improvement of metabolic myoclonus with thalamic (VIM) deep brain stimulation (DBS). BACKGROUND: Myoclonus is a sudden, brief, involuntary jerking caused by abrupt muscle contraction (positive myoclonus) or discontinuation of ongoing muscular activity (negative myoclonus). Its pathophysiology is incompletely understood, though cerebellar influences on cortical excitability have been suggested. Case reports have described improvement in anoxic myoclonus after pallidal and thalamic DBS. DESIGN/METHODS: An 85-year old right-handed man with coronary artery disease, COPD and essential tremor treated with left VIM DBS since 2003 developed disabling, multi-focal, spontaneous and action-induced positive and negative myoclonus in all extremities in the context of acute on chronic renal failure, worsening hypercapnia, and high-dose gabapentin therapy (1200mg/day). Myoclonus prevented safe ambulation and impaired activities of daily living. Clinical evaluation of tremor and myoclonus in stimulation OFF and ON conditions was performed. RESULT(S): DBS settings: 0(-) 1(+) 3.7 V 150 musec 185 Hz. With DBS OFF, there was frequent myoclonus of the tongue and arms more than legs. Postural and action tremor were moderate on the left and mild on the right. There was profound negative myoclonus upon standing and inability to ambulate. Handwriting was illegible. Spirals were severely impaired because of tremor and myoclonus. Water pouring was severely impaired, L>R, secondary to myoclonus. With DBS ON, myoclonus frequency and amplitude improved, R>L. Right postural tremor resolved. He could walk several steps without assistance. Handwriting, spirals and pouring on the right dramatically improved. Pouring on the left improved but not completely. Tremor Research Group (TRG) scales OFF and ON were 31.5 and 16.5, showing a 47.6% reduction with stimulation. CONCLUSION(S): This case report suggests that modulation of cerebello-thalamo-cortical loops can improve myoclonus and provides insight into mechanisms underlying myoclonus.",0,,3.7,
48,"TMS is being increasingly used as a noninvasive brain stimulation technique for the therapeutic management of partial epilepsies. However, the acute effects of TMS on epileptiform discharges (EDs, i.e. interictal epileptiform activity and subclinical electrographic seizure patterns) remain unexplored. To investigate whether TMS can modulate EDs in partial epilepsy. In Experiment Set 1, the safety of the TMS protocol was investigated in 10 well-controlled by anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) epileptic patients. In Experiment Set 2, the effects of TMS on EDs were studied in three subjects with intractable frontal lobe epilepsies, characterized by particularly frequent EDs. TMS was applied over the electrographic focus with a circular and a figure of eight coil while recording EEG with a 60-channel TMS-compatible EEG system. The effectiveness of TMS in aborting EDs was investigated using survival analysis and brain connectivity analysis. The TMS protocol was well-tolerated. TMS was an effective method to abort EDs even when adjusting for its latency with respect to ED onset (CMH test, p < 0.0001). While the effective brain connectivity around the epileptic focus increased significantly during EDs (p < 0.01), with TMS administration the increase was not statistically significant. TMS can modulate EDs in patients with epileptogenic foci in the cortical convexity and is associated with reversal of ED-induced changes in brain connectivity.",3,,,
49,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to study the effect of recurrent seizures on cortical excitability over time in epilepsy. 77 patients with firm diagnoses of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) or focal epilepsy were repeatedly evaluated over three years. At onset, all groups had increased cortical excitability. At the end of follow-up the refractory group was associated with a broad increase in cortical excitability. Conversely, cortical excitability decreased in all seizure free groups after introduction of an effective medication.",77,,,
50,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well established treatment for essential tremor and for the tremor associated with Parkinson's disease. The efficacy of DBS in these common tremors has led some investigators to apply the technique to rarer tremors such as such as Holmes' tremor, posttraumatic tremor, orthostatic tremor, and the tremor associated with multiple sclerosis. Likewise, DBS of the thalamus and globus pallidus directly suppresses levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease, suggesting the application of DBS to other hyperkinetic states such as Huntington's disease, tardive dyskinesia, and hemiballism. Myoclonus has also been treated with DBS, especially in cases where it is associated with dystonia. This chapter reviews the reported results of DBS for these conditions. Due to the rarity of these indications, most of the literature reviewed takes the form of case reports or small single-center case series. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",0,,,
51,"Background: Many patients with epilepsy have persistent seizures despite treatment with maximal antiepileptic drug therapy and are not candidates for resective brain surgery. Objective(s): We investigated the effectiveness of seizure reduction after anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) stimulation in patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus. Method(s): Patients included in this study had poorly controlled seizures, despite anticonvulsant medication, and were not candidates for surgical resection of an identifiable seizure focus. Fifteen patients with medically refractory epilepsy underwent the placement of bilateral DBS electrodes in the anterior thalamus. The seizure frequency was monitored and compared with the preimplantation baseline. Result(s): The treatment demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the seizure frequency, with a mean reduction of 70.4% (mean follow-up, 27 months). Two of the patients had a remarkable reduction of seizure frequency. Conclusion(s): It seems to be important that the short-term outcome of ATN DBS reflects the long-term outcome directly. The correlation between the seizure type, characteristics and anticonvulsant effects of ATN DBS did not exhibit significance because of the small number of cases. Therefore, a longer-term follow-up with a larger group of patients is required to fully evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this treatment modality. © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.",15,,,
52,"In neocortical epilepsy, we showed that the seizure onset defined by ictal high-frequency oscillations (HFO: >=70 Hz) with subsequent evolution into slower frequency activity (i.e., HFOs+) was smaller in spatial distribution than that defined by conventional frequency activity (1-70 Hz), and that resection of HFO+ areas resulted in favorable seizure outcome. This study further investigates ictal broadband EEG in the same cohort of patients by examining the infraslow activity, including ictal baseline (""direct current"") shifts (IBS) and peri-ictal infraslow activity (0.02 to 0.2 Hz). The seizure onset zone had been defined and resected based on HFO+ by a prospectively defined protocol. We reviewed 11 representative seizures from 6 patients by visual and spectral analyses using appropriate filters and timescales. The HFO seizure onset, in the high gamma or ripple frequency, preceded or followed the IBS closely (<300 ms). The IBS were negative or positive, ~1 mV in amplitude and 2 to 3 seconds long. Although the HFO+ were always ipsilateral to the surgical hemisphere, the IBS could be ipsilateral or contralateral. Compared with conventional frequency activity, the HFO+ and IBS were significantly smaller in spatial distribution and likely to be concordant. The peri-ictal infraslow activity consisted of distinct periodic or rhythmic (0.12 to 0.16 Hz) patterns, poorly concordant with IBS or HFO+. Although not statistically significant, better seizure outcome tended to correlate with smaller seizure onset zones and more complete resection of the HFO+ and IBS contacts. We conclude that IBS, like HFO+, define a smaller seizure onset zone and probably a more accurate epileptogenic zone in neocortical epilepsy.

53,"Purpose: This study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Method(s): Sixty-four patients with refractory focal epilepsy were screened and 60 patients were randomly divided into two groups by stimulation intensity: 90% (group 1) or 20% (group 2) of resting motor threshold (rMT). Seizure frequency and interictal EEG epileptic discharges were compared between the baseline and follow-up periods. Key Findings: Seizures significantly decreased following 2-weeks high intensity (90% rMT) rTMS treatment compared with baseline level (p < 0.05). rTMS also decreased interictal epilepsy discharges and improved the scales of Symptom Checklist-90 significantly (p < 0.05). Seizures and spikes in the follow-up period in the patients who received low intensity (20% rMT) rTMS did not show any difference compared with baseline data (p > 0.05, respectively). Significance: Low-frequency high intensity rTMS (90% rMT) delivered into the epileptogenic zone had a significant antiepileptic effect on patients with refractory partial seizures. rTMS treatment can also reduce the interictal epileptic discharge frequency and improve the psychological condition of these patients. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2012 International League Against Epilepsy.",64,,,
54,"A 28-year-old patient with pharmacoresistant non-lesional right frontal epilepsy underwent extra-operative intracranial EEG recordings and electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) to map eloquent cortex. Right supplementary motor area (SMA) ECS induced a brief seizure with habitual symptoms involving neck tingling followed by asymmetric tonic posturing. An additional feature was neck atonia. During atonia and sensory aura, discharges were seen in the mesial frontal electrodes and precentral gyrus. Besides motor signs, atonia, although rare and not described in the neck muscles, and sensations have been reported with SMA stimulation. The mechanisms underlying neck atonia in seizures arising from the SMA can be explained by supplementary negative motor area (SNMA) - though this was not mapped in electrodes overlying the ictal onset zone in our patient - or primary sensorimotor cortex activation through rapid propagation. Given the broad spectrum of signs elicited by SMA stimulation and rapid spread of seizures arising from the SMA, caution should be taken to not diagnose these as non-epileptic, as had previously occurred in this patient. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",0,,,
55,"Aims: Juvenile idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) show overlapping clinical and encephalographic features. The genetic basis of these disorders remains poorly understood due their polygenic inheritance pattern. The aim of this study was to investigate whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows the characterization of specific endophenotypes, thereby facilitating the identification of individual susceptibility genes. Method(s): We examined 18 healthy controls, 10 subjects with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), 11 with epilepsy with grand mal on awakening (EGMA), and 10 with juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), ranging in age from 10 and 19 years by means of TMS. 24 out of 31 patients were treated with antiepileptic drugs. We measured resting motor threshold (RMT), active motor threshold (AMT), cortical stimulation-induced silent period (CSP), intracortical inhibition (ICF) at an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2ms, and intracortical facilitation at an ISI of 15ms. All TMS-parameters were compared between the groups by means of the ANOVA on ranks. In case a significant difference was detected, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for further pairwise comparisons between the single groups. Result(s): Only ICI differed significantly between all groups (p=.009). The post-hoc-analysis revealed that this was due to significant differences between patients with JME and healthy controls (median: 87 [69;123]% vs. 37 [26;74]%, p=0.001), and between patients with JME and JAE (87 [69;123]% vs. 41 [31;68]%, p=0.005). Patients with EGMA also showed higher ICI values (52 [19;88]%) than normal controls and patients with JAE, but these differences did not reach significance (p>0.05). Conclusion(s): TMS revealed an impaired cortical inhibition in a substantial amount of patients with juvenile IGE. This specific neurophysiologic deficit appears to contribute predominantly to the phenotype of JME, while is seems not to play a role in the pathogenesis of JAE. The endophenotype of a decreased cortical inhibition can add as a TMS-marker to the elucidation of the genetic basis of IGE.",31,,,
56,"Purpose: We report a case of seizure reduction after deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nuclei (STN) in a patient with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and Parkinson disease. Method(s): A 61-year-old woman had experienced her first seizure at 10 years of age. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred during sleep. Her seizures occurred several times per year while she was taking 800 mg valproate. She also started experiencing bradykinesia and limb tremor at 51 years of age. She was diagnosed with Parkinson disease and received medical treatment. She was finding it difficult to walk; as a result, she was referred to the neurosurgery department for DBS surgery at 54 years of age. Result(s): Presurgical evaluation revealed no epileptic discharges during long-term electroencephalography monitoring. Valproate was discontinued and STN-DBS was performed uneventfully. Bradykinesia and bilateral tremor improved markedly after DBS. When the estimated electrical current was changed from 31.9 to 12.2 microampere at 5 months after DBS, the first postoperative seizure occurred, and administration of 400 mg valproate was restarted. One year later, when the estimated electrical current was changed from 29.3 to 15.6 microampere, the second and third postoperative seizures occurred. The estimated current was changed from 15.6 to 20.5 microampere and the patient was administered 400 mg of valproate, after which she has remained seizure free for 5.5 years. Conclusion(s): Stimulation current conditions may be responsible for generalized seizure. The comorbidities of idiopathic generalized epilepsy and Parkinson disease showed improvement after STN-DBS. However appropriate stimulation conditions are required for seizure reduction.",1,,,
57,"Purpose: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus is an emerging surgical option for medically refractory epilepsy sufferers who are not suitable for resective surgery, or where surgery has failed. In a singleblind within-subject control study, we evaluate the efficacy of DBS of centromedian nucleus (CMN) for seizure control as well as quality-of-life outcome in symptomatic generalised epilepsy (SGE), and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Method(s): Eleven patients were recruited (8 males, 3 females) at King's College Hospital (London, UK) and Hospital de la Princesa (Madrid, Spain). Six patients had removal of the VNS device before DBS implantation. Ages at surgery range from 18 to 51 years (mean 37). Average follow- up period is 2 years. Six patients had SGE and five FLE. Seizure diaries were kept by patients/parents prospectively. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) were completed at regular time-points. Result(s): Among the 6 patients with SGE, 2 patients became seizure free for more than 4 years, 3 had seizure frequency reduction greater than 50% and one had seizure reduction of 37.5%. None of the patients with FLE became seizure free, 2 had a reduction greater than 50% and 2 showed no change. PRO questionnaires showed improvement in approximately 50% of patients. Conclusion(s): DBS of CMN appears to be effective in improving seizure control and patient related outcomes in patients with generalised epilepsy and possibly in frontal lobe epilepsy.",6,,,
58,"Aim. Evaluation of long-term efficacy in children with refractory focal epilepsy treated by vagus nerve stimulation. Methods.We retrospectively analysed 15 children with intractable focal epilepsy treated by vagus nerve stimulation. The inclusion criteriawere: age younger than 18 years at the time of VNS implantation, confirmed electroclinical diagnosis of refractory focal cryptogenic or symptomatic epilepsy without the possibility of resective surgery, and at least 12 months follow-up after VNS implantation. We analysed the effectiveness at 1, 2 and 5 years of follow-up. We counted the average number of urgent hospitalisations per year for each patient before and after the VNS implantation. The study population consisted of 15 children; 6 males and 9 females. The median age at time of implantation was 14.6+/-2.5 years and median duration of epilepsy before implantation was 11.0+/-3.4 years. The preoperative investigation identified symptomatic aetiology in 10 patients (66.7%) and cryptogenic aetiology in the remaining 5 patients (33.3%). We were also able to determine the probable localisation of the seizure onset zoneduring the preoperative investigation. Eight patients had extratemporal epilepsy (53.3%), 1 patient temporal lobe epilepsy (6.7%) and in the remaining 6 patients (40%) the multifocal ictal onsets were revealed. Of the children with extratemporal epilepsies, 7 had frontal lobe epilepsy (of whom four were without any clear lateralisation, 2 with onset on the left and 1 on the right side) and 1 patient had seizure onset in the operculo-insular region on the right side. Nine of 15 patients (60%) had partial seizures (PS) only, 5 patients (33.3%) had a combination of PS and generalised tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and 1 patient had GTCS only. Results. The mean seizure reduction was 42.5% at 1, 54.9% at 2, and 58.3% at 5 years. The number of responders was 7 (46.7%) at 1 and 9 (60%) at both 2 and 5 years, respectively. The average monthly frequency of all epileptic seizures preoperatively was 71.9+/-52.7.We observed the gradual decrease of seizure count postoperatively (43.7+/-46.1 at 1, 35.9+/-38.4 at 2, and 29.0+/-36.4 at 5 years, postoperatively) (p<0.001, in comparison to the preoperative period). The mean number of urgent hospitalisations per one patient was 1.0+/-0.6 per year, preoperatively and 0.3+/-0.5 per year, postoperatively (p<0.0001). A serious adverse event was observed in one patient (late-onset asystole). Conclusion.Vagus nerve stimulation is an effective and relatively safe method for treating children with refractory focal epilepsy.",15,,,
59,"Objective: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) modifies brain function by using a magnetic field to induce electrical currents in cortical neurones. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) in experimental models can increase seizure threshold, and clinical application of prolonged sequential rTMS in adults with poorly controlled epilepsy has reduced seizure frequency. Preliminary to assessing the efficacy of rTMA as a potential treatment for children with severe epilepsy, we carried out a prospective non-randomized pilot study of tolerability and acceptability. Method(s): Twenty children aged 5 to 15 years with severe epilepsy unresponsive to three anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) received 20 minutes of low frequency rTMS on each of five consecutive days using a Medtronic dual pulse stimulator with figure-eight coil. Exclusion criteria included metallic implants, cortical neurosurgery, and vagal nerve stimulation. EEG was recorded before, during and after the treatment, and at 1, 2, and 6 months follow-up. Diaries of seizure frequency, duration, and type were completed for the same period, with pre- and post-treatment cognitive assessment. Result(s): Formal psychometric testing was inappropriate in 10 (50%) with severe developmental delay. Two children were withdrawn from the study during treatment because of seizures suddenly worsened. All other children completed the treatment, which was well tolerated. One child had nausea and vomiting on the first treatment day, which resolved; no other side-effects were reported and no seizures occurred during treatment. Improvement in seizure frequency was reported in four of the 18 children completing the treatment, with a corresponding decrease in EEG epileptic spiking in two. Conclusion(s): For children with severe epilepsy unresponsive to drug treatment, rTMS may offer an alternative that is easily administered, well tolerated, non-invasive, compatible with medication and free of serious side-effects. Based on this pilot, a larger placebo-controlled study is required to assess efficacy.",0,,,
60,"Patients with medically intractable epilepsy who are not candidates for epilepsy surgery could benefit from neurostimulation. At this time, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy is the only Food and Drug Administation-approved neurostimulation modality; it has been shown to be efficacious and just as well tolerated in children and adolescents as in adults. Notwithstanding the initial cost of the device and implantation, VNS therapy has been shown to be a cost-effective treatment, reducing direct medical costs and improving health-related quality of life measures. Deep brain stimulation of various brain regions, especially the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and responsive neurostimulation, also appear effective but are not yet approved for clinical use. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which is also in early clinical development, is promising and could become available in the not too distant future. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0,,,
61,"Objectives: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial assessed the safety and effectiveness of responsive cortical stimulation as an adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures in adults with medically refractory epilepsy. Method(s): A total of 191 adults with medically intractable partial epilepsy were implanted with a responsive neurostimulator connected to depth or subdural leads placed at 1 or 2 predetermined seizure foci. The neurostimulator was programmed to detect abnormal electrocorticographic activity. One month after implantation, subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive stimulation in response to detections (treatment) or to receive no stimulation (sham). Efficacy and safety were assessed over a 12-week blinded period and a subsequent 84-week open-label period during which all subjects received responsive stimulation. Result(s): Seizures were significantly reduced in the treatment (-37.9%, n = 97) compared to the sham group (-17.3%, n = 94; p = 0.012) during the blinded period and there was no difference between the treatment and sham groups in adverse events. During the open-label period, the seizure reduction was sustained in the treatment group and seizures were significantly reduced in the sham group when stimulation began. There were significant improvements in overall quality of life (p < 0.02) and no deterioration in mood or neuropsychological function. Conclusion(s): Responsive cortical stimulation reduces the frequency of disabling partial seizures, is associated with improvements in quality of life, and is well-tolerated with no mood or cognitive effects. Responsive stimulation may provide another adjunctive treatment option for adults with medically intractable partial seizures. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that responsive cortical stimulation is effective in significantly reducing seizure frequency for 12 weeks in adults who have failed 2 or more antiepileptic medication trials,3or more seizures per month, and 1 or 2 seizure foci. © 2011 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.",0,,,
62,"Rationale: Vagus nerve stimulation and callosal section are the available palliative surgical options in patients with secondary generalized epilepsy. DBS has been increasingly used in the treatment of refractory epilepsy over the last decade. We report on the outcome after CM-DBS in patients with generalized epilepsy who had been previously treated with extended callosal section. Method(s): Six consecutive patients with generalized epilepsy who were previously submitted to callosal section and had at least 1 year of follow-up after deep brain implantation were studied. Age ranged from 10 to 44 years. All patients were submitted to bilateral CM thalamic DBS. Post-operative CT scans documented the electrode position in all patients. All patients had pre- and post-stimulation prolonged interictal scalp EEG recordings, including spike counts. Attention level was evaluated by means of the SNAP-IV questionnaire. The preimplantation anti-epileptic drug regimen was maintained postoperatively in all patients. Continuous stimulation was carried out using 300usec, 130Hz, 4-6V pulses. Result(s): Post-operative CT documented that all electrodes were correctly located. There was no morbidity or mortality. Seizure frequency reduction ranging from 55 to 95% and increased attention level was seen in all patients. Interictal spiking frequency was reduced from 25 to 95%, but their morphology remained the same. There was re-synchronization of interictal discharges during slow-wave sleep in 3 patients. Conclusion(s): All patients benefit from the procedure. The CM seems to play a role in modulating the epileptic discharges and attention in these patients. On the other hand, it is not the generator of the epileptic abnormality and appeared not to be involved in non-REM sleep-related interictal spiking modulation.",6,,6.0,
63,"Background: Abnormally enhanced cortical rhythmic activities have been reported in patients with cortical myoclonus. We recently reported a new triad-conditioning transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) method to detect the intrinsic rhythms of the primary motor cortex (M1). Triad-conditioning TMS revealed a 40-Hz intrinsic rhythm of M1 in normal subjects. In this investigation, we study the motor cortical facilitation induced by rhythmic triple TMS pulses (triad-conditioning TMS) in patients with cortical myoclonus. Method(s): Subjects were 7 patients with cortical myoclonus (28-74 years old) and 13 healthy volunteers (30-71 years old). Three conditioning stimuli over M1 at the intensity of 110% active motor threshold preceded the test TMS at various interstimulus intervals corresponding to 10-200 Hz. The resulting amplitudes of conditioned motor evoked potentials recorded from the contralateral hand muscle were compared with those evoked by the test stimulus alone. Result(s): The facilitation at 25 ms (40 Hz) observed in normal subjects was absent in patients with cortical myoclonus. Instead, triad-conditioning TMS induced facilitation at a 40 ms interval (25 Hz) in cortical myoclonus. Discussion(s): This change in the timing of facilitation may be explained by a shift of the most preferential intrinsic rhythm of M1, or by some dysfunction in the interneuronal network in cortical myoclonus. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society.",7,,,
64,"Experimental and clinical data suggest that high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of different subcortical structures can be used to control or modulate epileptic seizures. Recent studies showed that DBS of the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) in rats has an anticonvulsant effect on forebrain clonic seizures. The aim of this study was to determine whether DBS of SNr could also suppress tonic epileptic seizures evoked in hindbrain structures. DBS with high frequency often mimics the effects of surgical ablation of a particular area of the brain. However, the optimal parameters of DBS stimulation to induce ablation-like effects on seizures are not well defined. Consequently, in the first experiment we examined the effects of different stimulation frequencies (80, 130, 260 and 390 Hz) on neuronal activation induced in SNr, using c- fos immunocytochemistry. The results showed that the stimulation of the SNr with 80 Hz has no inhibitory effect while stimulation with 130, 260 and 390 Hz produced a remarkable suppressive effect compared with the control unstimulated side. The aim of the second experiment was to determine whether bilateral inhibition of SNr with DBS could suppress tonic seizures induced by electric shock. Statistical analysis showed that the mean tonic seizure scores following SNr stimulation with either 130 or 260 Hz were not significantly different from scores following the application of the electrode without current. The data suggest that DBS of the SNr produces neuronal inhibition but fails to suppress tonic seizures. We conclude, therefore, that DBS of SNr with frequencies used in this study might not be effective for treatment of patients who suffer from tonic epileptic seizures. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0,,,
65,"Purpose: To evaluate the antiepileptic efficacy of low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in medically intractable epilepsy. Method(s): A comprehensive literature search was performed on articles published from 1990 to 2010 in Medline, Pubmed, CINAHL, and Cochrane using the following keywords: epilepsy, seizure, transcranial magnetic stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Two reviewers assessed article eligibility and extracted the data independently. For outcome measures, effect size and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for seizure frequency, spike number, duration of epileptiform abnormalities (EAs), and resting motor threshold (RMT) by using fixed and random effect models. Result(s): Eleven articles were identified, with a total of 164 participants. Based on seizure frequency, a significant effect size was found (effect size: 0.34, with a 95% CI at 0.10-0.57). Considering between-study heterogeneity, we conducted a second meta-analysis, and the underlying etiology was considered important for the treatment effect. Cortical dysplasia or neocortical epilepsy showed an effect size of 0.71, with a 95% CI at 0.30-1.12. In contrast, other epileptic disorders showed an effect size of 0.22. Conclusion(s): Low frequency rTMS has a favorable effect on seizure reduction, particularly evident in patients with neocortical epilepsy or cortical dysplasia. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",0,,,
66,"Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare, idiopathic disorder characterized by a failure of automatic respiration. Abnormalities such as seizure disorder, failure to thrive, and Hirschsprung disease have been associated with CCHS. In this report, the authors discuss the use of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) to treat a medically refractory seizure disorder in a child who had previously undergone placement of bilateral phrenic nerve stimulators for treatment of CCHS. Concomitant use of phrenic and vagal nerve stimulators has not previously been reported in the literature. No adverse reactions were noted with both devices working. Diaphragmatic pacing (DP) was clinically unaffected by VNS. The patient experienced a marked reduction in seizure frequency and severity following vagal nerve stimulator placement. Based on this case, the authors conclude that VNS is a potentially safe and efficacious treatment option for seizure disorder associated with CCHS in patients undergoing DP. ©1944-2011 by the American Association of Neurosurgeons.",1,,,
67,"Surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy with deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been shown to be of therapeutic benefit in some patients and with the recent publication of a randomised control study its use is likely to increase in the future. We describe a patient who developed a focal epileptic seizure within a few seconds of momentarily turning off the DBS stimulator in the nucleus ventralis oralis posterior, with which she was successfully treated for tremor. The seizure was the result of a newly diagnosed primary brain tumor. We suggest that the nucleus ventralis oralis posterior may be another thalamic target of DBS in epilepsy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

68,"BACKGROUND: Cortical stimulation is under investigation in clinical trials of drugresistant epilepsy. Results are heterogeneous; therefore, more evidence from animal studies is required. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the therapeutic effects of parameters of direct stimulation of the cortical focus in a Macaca fascicularis presenting focal motor epilepsy. METHOD(S): We developed a model of motor seizures after intracortical injection of penicillin G in the primary motor cortex of a Macaca fascicularis. We performed electric epidural cortical stimulation at low, medium, and high frequency using continuous or short-term stimulation. Short-term stimulation was triggered on seizure onset, either visually or automatically with a seizure detection algorithm connected to a programmable stimulator. RESULT(S): Automated detection could detect 100% of the seizures, but ensuing cortical electric stimulation failed to abort seizures. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates the inefficacy of the stimulation of the cortical focus to prevent seizures induced by local injection of penicillin G. Because this model may be too severe to allow comparison to human epilepsies, further work is required in other monkey models of focal epilepsy.

69,"Epileptic foci can influence cortical excitability, brain perfusion and metabolism not only directly in the focus or perifocally, but also in remote areas. Effects of successful epilepsy surgery on cortical networks and changes in excitability have rarely been addressed. We report a study on changes in interhemispheric inhibition following successful surgical removal of an epileptic focus. Eighteen patients (11 females, 7 males, mean age 34.2 years) were enrolled in this transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study. All patients were seizure free after surgery and had identical antiepileptic medication pre- and postsurgically. Investigations were performed before and at least 3 months after surgery. Motor thresholds (MT) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of interhemispheric paired pulse paradigms were investigated on both hemispheres. Resection of the epileptic focus resulted in a significant change in interhemispheric inhibition (IHI). The ability of the non-focal hemisphere to inhibit the motor cortex (M1) of the focal hemisphere significantly increased (p = 0.02) and normalized to the level of the other hemisphere. In summary, this TMS study suggests that an epileptic focus can modulate interhemispheric inhibitory interactions between the motor cortices. A decreased susceptibility of M1 of the focal hemisphere or alterations in the non-focal hemispheric inhibitory output may be underlying mechanisms. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of widespread functional impairments in focal epilepsy. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",18,,,
70,"Purpose: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of chronic high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) in adult patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) syndromes. Method(s): Five adult patients (four male, 28-39 years) with PME underwent chronic high-frequency DBS according to a study protocol that had been approved by the local ethics committee. Electrodes were implanted in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)/subthalamic nucleus (STN) region in the first patient and additionally in the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) bilaterally in the following four cases. Follow-up took place in intervals of 3 months and DBS effects were compared with baseline frequency of passive and activation-induced myoclonic jerks and daily life performance 8 weeks prior to implantation. Key Findings: Follow-up periods ranged from 12-42 months (median 24 months). The best clinical effects were seen with SNr/STN DBS in all patients. VIM stimulation failed to achieve acute therapeutic effects and revealed low side-effect thresholds and even triggering of myoclonia. In all patients the reduction of myoclonic seizures was observed and ranged between 30% and 100% as quantified by a standardized video protocol. All patients reported clinically relevant improvements of various capabilities such as free standing and walking or improved fine motor skills. In one patient with an excellent initial response generalized tonic - clonic seizures increased after 3 months of stimulation following extensive trauma-related surgery. The best effect was seen in the least impaired patient. Significance: DBS of the SNr/STN may be an effective treatment option for patients with PME. Less impaired patients may benefit more markedly.

71,"Seventeen refractory partial epilepsy patients were enrolled in an open-label study to evaluate the antiepileptic effect of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Seven of the patients had not obtained seizure-free status after epileptogenic focus resection surgery before they were enrolled in the study. All patients were treated with low-frequency rTMS which included 3 sessions per day (0.5 Hz, 90% RMT and 500 pulses each session) and lasted for 2 weeks. Seizure frequency, seizure days and epileptic discharges in the EEG obtained before, during and after stimulation were compared. The psychological conditions of all individual patients were evaluated with Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) before and after rTMS treatment. Mean seizure frequencies per week significantly decreased in the following 4-week rTMS treatment period compared with the pre-treatment period (14.09 vs. 5.63, p < 0.05, mean reduction of 60.02% in seizure frequency). Mean seizure days per week during the treatment period and the post-treatment period were lower than that of the pre-treatment period (5.18 vs. 2.99 p < 0.05, mean reduction of 42.5% in seizure days). Mean epileptic discharges in the EEG decreased significantly during the treatment period compared to that of the pre-treatment period (78.60 vs. 66.09, p < 0.05, mean reduction of 15.9% in epileptic spikes discharges) in all 17 patients. Fourteen patients completed the test of Symptom Checklist-90 effectively. The scales of Global Severity Index, Depression, Anxiety, Phobic anxiety, Paranoid ideation, Psychoticism, Somatization, Obsession-compulsion, Interpersonal sensitivity, Hostility in patients decreased respectively at the post-treatment periods compared with those of the pre-treatment periods (P < 0.05). Low-frequency rTMS may have a significant antiepileptic effect in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Additionally, our results indicate rTMS treatment can improve the psychological condition of these patients.",17,,,
72,"We report two cases of chronic therapeutic stimulation of epileptic foci localized in motor areas. Case 1 is an adolescent with supplementary motor area seizures whose intracranial recordings showed a right SMA focus. Case 2 is a female teenager with primary motor seizures originating in the right motor cortex in the hand area as shown by her intracranial recordings and cortical mapping. Both had apparently normal MRI. Chronic stimulation of the epileptic focus decreased the number of seizures more than 90% the seizure number while preserving motor function. None of the patients had side effects. Neuromodulation is proposed as a safe, efficient surgical alternative for motor seizure control.",0,,,
73,"Following a total of 386 deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedures in Oxford, only two seizures have been recorded in the peri-operative period. Both patients had MS and underwent thalamic DBS for tremor and these 2 cases are presented here. The incidence of peri-operative seizures in MS patients undergoing DBS procedures is more than 8-fold greater than that expected for patients undergoing DBS procedures. Further experience with DBS procedures in MS patients is needed to determine whether there is a role for peri-operative anticonvulsants in these patients. © 2010 The Neurosurgical Foundation.",0,,,
74,"INTRODUCTION: Many patients with epilepsy have persistent seizures despite maximal antiepileptic drug therapy and are not candidates for resective brain surgery. We investigated the effectiveness of seizure reduction after anterior thalamic stimulation in patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus. METHOD(S): Fifteen patients with medically refractory epilepsy underwent bilateral DBS electrodes in the anterior thalamus. Seizure frequency and intensity were monitored and compared with pre-implantation baseline. The following outcome variables were assessed: (a) total seizure-frequency between postoperative 3 month and preoperative baseline (b) total seizure-frequency between postoperative 3 month and the last followup. Range in seizure reduction percentage was bounded at -100 and +100% (seizure-free). Seizure intensity at last visit was also assessed. (2: much improved; 1: slightly improved; 0: no interval change) RESULTS: The follow-up patients were 15 (9 males and 6 females). Median age at the operation was 30.53 years (range, 14-54 years) (Table 1). Treatment showed a statistically significant decrease in seizure frequency, with a mean reduction of 70.5% (mean follow-up, 39 months). Two of the patients had a remarkable reduction of seizure intensity as well as seizure frequency (Table 2). Seizure frequency per month at postoperative 3-month and last follow-up period after ATN DBS shows significant reduction of seizure frequency (P =.002, P =.001, respectively). Reduction percentage of seizure frequency at postoperative 3-month has significant relation with reduction percentage of seizure frequency at last follow-up period (P = .032)(Figure 1). CONCLUSION(S): It seems to be important that short term outcome of ATN DBS reflects long term outcome directly. The correlation between seizure type, characteristics and anticonvulsant effect of ATN DBS did not showed significantly because of small case numbers. Therefore longerterm follow-up with larger group of patients is required to fully evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this treatment modality.",15,,,
75,"Objective: The low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment on patients with intractable epilepsy often shows variable antiepileptic effects, and its mechanisms remain to be understood. We aimed to further investigate the effectiveness of rTMS on intractable epilepsy, and study whether cortical excitability, and cerebral blood flow could change after rTMS treatment by using evoked resting motor threshold (ERMT) and single photo emission computered tomography (SPECT), respectively. Method(s): We enrolled 4 patients with localization-related epilepsy who had experienced at least 1 seizure per month after regular antiepileptic medications for at least 1 year. rTMS treatment was administered at 0.5 Hz and 45% of the stimulator's maxiumum output for 10 consecutive days. Frequency of seizures was determined for 3 months before and after rTMS. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded before and after rTMS, respectively. Each recording was no less than 1hour, and the number of interictal spikes was counted. ERMT and SPECT were used to investigate the changes of cortical excitability and cerebral blood flow, respectively. Result(s): In all patients, seizure frequency was significantly decreased after rTMS treatment: only one patient had a generalized seizure at the third month; the other three patients had no seizures in the subsequent 3-month follow-up. The SPECT analysis showed the cerebral perfusion a conspicuous decrease around the stimulated regions in all patients. EEG displayed a minimal improvement on the epileptiform discharges (-20%) in a patient after rTMS. The ERMT was found to be significantly elevated after rTMS treatment in these 4 patients studied. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that rTMS was effective in the treatment of patients with intractable epilepsy, and this effect might be related to the elevation of EMRT and the reduction of the cerebral perfusion in the epileptogenetic zones. However, this clinical research was based on very small population. Larger population is needed for further study.",4,,,
76,"Background: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is being increasingly used as a non-invasive brain stimulation technique for the therapeutic management of partial epilepsies. A number of open label and controlled studies provided evidence for a modest but statistically significant reduction in the frequency of seizures and interictal discharges after the application of repetitive TMS stimuli. However, the acute effects of TMS on epileptiform discharges in partial epilepsy remains unexplored. Objective(s): To investigate whether TMS can terminate epileptiform discharges in patients with partial epilepsy. Method(s): Three subjects (median age, 32 years) with drug resistant frontal lobe epilepsies characterized by particularly frequent epileptiform discharges (EDs), were studied. Seizure etiology included perisylvian syndrome (1 case) and head trauma (2 cases). In all patients, the epileptogenic focus was located in the hemispheric convexity on the right and was easily accessible to transcranial stimulation. TMS was applied over the area of the electrographic focus with a figure of 8 coil while simultaneously recording EEG with a 60-channel TMS-compatible EEG system (eXimia, Nexstim Ltd, Finland). TMS stimuli (trains of 1-10 stimuli at 1-3 Hz and 100% MSO stimulus intensity) were delivered at variable treatment latencies after the onset of EDs (range 0.5-10 secs). The effectiveness of TMS in aborting EDs was investigated using survival analysis. Result(s): With TMS, epileptiform discharges stopped within 2 seconds in 48 out of 59 cases. Without TMS, EDs stopped within 2 seconds in only 6 out of 55 cases. TMS was an effective method to abort EDs and this was statistically established even when adjusting for the treatment latency (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test: p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that repetitive TMS can terminate epileptiform discharges in patients with superficial epileptogenic foci. These preliminary data add to the limited current evidence that TMS can be used for the acute treatment of seizures.",3,,,
77,"Purpose: We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate whether there were any characteristic cortical excitability changes in progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) compared to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Method(s): Six patients with PME were studied. Motor threshold (MT) at rest and recovery curve analysis using paired-pulse stimulation at a number of interstimulus intervals (ISIs) was determined. Results were compared to those of 9 patients with chronic refractory JME and 10 with chronic well-controlled JME. Result(s): PME showed a marked increase in cortical excitability at all the long ISIs (p < 0.01), compared to refractory JME (effect sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.9) and well-controlled JME (effect sizes ranging from 2.0 to 2.4). Significant differences at the short ISIs 2-5 ms were seen only on comparison with the well-controlled group (p < 0.05, effect size 0.6, 0.7). There were no significant differences in MTs of PME compared to either JME groups. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrate specific differences in cortical excitability using TMS between PME and those with JME, particularly at long latencies in the paired-pulse paradigm, implicating a role for I-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B-mediated networks. © 2010 International League Against Epilepsy.",9,,,
78,"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive method for brain stimulation. Group-studies applying rTMS in epilepsy patients aiming to decrease epileptic spike- or seizure-frequency have led to inconsistent results. Here we studied whether therapeutic trains of rTMS have detectable effects on individual spike pattern and/or frequency in patients suffering from focal epilepsy. Five patients with focal epilepsy underwent one session of rTMS online with EEG using a 6 Hz prime/1 Hz rTMS protocol (real and sham). The EEG was recorded continuously throughout the stimulation, and the epileptic spikes recorded immediately before (baseline) and after stimulation (sham and real) were subjected to further analysis. Number of spikes, spike-strength and spike-topography were examined. In two of the five patients, real TMS led to significant changes when compared to baseline and sham (decrease in spike-count in one patient, change in topography of the after-discharge in the other patient). Spike-count and topography remained unchanged the remaining patients. Overall, our results do not indicate a consistent effect of rTMS stimulation on interictal spike discharges, but speak in favor of a rather weak and individually variable immediate effect of rTMS on focal epileptic activity. The individuation of most effective stimulation patterns will be decisive for the future role of rTMS in epilepsies and needs to be determined in larger studies. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",5,,,
79,"Myoclonus-dystonia (M-D) is characterized by early onset myoclonus and dystonia. It is thought to be subcortical in origin. Response to oral medications may be incomplete, such that deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery to the globus pallidum interna (GPi) or ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) may be considered. The optimal site is not known. The physiology and surgical response for a 63-year-old woman who underwent GPi DBS for M-D with onset at age 2 and related to a mutation in the epsilon-sarcoglycan gene (SGCE) is described. She showed excellent clinical and neurophysiological improvement of both myoclonus and dystonia, suggesting that modulation by DBS is effective even after long disease duration and only partial response to oral medications. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

80,"Purpose: The quality of presurgical evaluation in focal extratemporal epilepsy surgery is highly dependent on precise structural and functional identification of the epileptic focus. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is a tool that combines the spatial information of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the functionality of non-invasive cortical stimulation. The non-invasive character of nTMS suggests that it could be a promising tool for presurgical evaluation of cortical excitability. Method(s): Presurgical nTMS evaluation was performed on an 8-year-old boy with left-sided intractable focal epilepsy, somatosensory auras and epilepsia partialis continua. In line with standardized procedures, motor evoked potentials were sought in both hemispheres over perirolandic cortex during simultaneous belly-tendon surface recordings of the first dorsal interosseus muscles. Result(s): One singular motor-evoked potential (MEP) could be elicited in the unaffected hemisphere. In contrast, in the affected hemisphere MEPs could be elicited over a large area of the cortex even after the stimulation strength was reduced by at least 44%. Latency stratification in the affected hemisphere differentiated a motor from a sensory region of interest. Stimulation over the sensory region induced a sensory aura. The sensory site was concordant with a previous transient diffusion restriction found in an MRI two years prior to nTMS. Conclusion(s): NTMS can locate pathological excitability with high spatial precision. Future studies should compare nTMS with direct cortex stimulation, as well as the combination of nTMS with electroencephalography (EEG) in a larger patient-collective. © 2010-IOS Press and the authors.

83,"Background: Previous studies have shown that closed-loop or responsive neurostimulation can abort induced or spontaneous epileptiform discharges. Objective(s): To assess the effectiveness of a programmable cranially implanted closed-loop neurostimulation system in the control of seizures originating from an area relatively inaccessible by open craniotomy. Method(s): A patient with drug-resistant partial epilepsy had previously undergone open resection of the left frontal opercular cortex and the underlying insular area. Although subdural-depth electrode ictal recordings had been nonlocalizing, depth electrode insular stimulation had produced the patient's habitual aura. Postoperatively, there was a sustained 50% reduction in seizure frequency. The residual seizures were identical to the preoperative seizures. Repeat depth electrode monitoring revealed that the ictal focus was immediately posterior to the previously resected insular area. A closed-loop cranial internal pulse generator system including left anterior insular and posterior orbitofrontal depth electrodes was implanted. Result(s): There was an additional 60% reduction of seizures. Conclusion(s): Preliminary observation indicates that responsive neurostimulation may be an effective alternative to higher-risk resective epilepsy surgery. Copyright © 2010 S.

84,Cortical areas that control ear movement have not been reported in humans. We describe a rare case in which ear auricle movement was induced by extraoperative electrical cortical stimulation. A 21-year-old man with intractable localization-related epilepsy was admitted for presurgical evaluation. Subdural electrodes were implanted over the right temporal and frontal regions. Tonic upward contraction of the left ear auricle was elicited by stimulating the subdural electrode on the posterior portion of the right superior temporal gyrus close to the end of the Sylvian fissure. No other body movements or auditory symptoms were elicited. A possible mechanism underlying this rare phenomenon is discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.,0,,,
85,"Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides information about magnitude (diffusivity) and directionality (fractional anisotropy, FA) of water diffusion and allows visualization of major white matter tracts. The arcuate fasciculus (AF) connects anterior (Broca's) and posterior (Wernicke's) language areas. We hypothesized that essential language areas identified by direct cortical stimulation would colocalize with areas revealing subcortical connectivity via the AF. Method(s): Fourteen patients with pharmacoresistant left hemispheric epilepsy and left hemisphere language dominance underwent invasive evaluations for localization of epileptogenicity and functional mapping. DTI and TI-weighted volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were coregistered, and subdural grid electrodes identified on postimplantation computed tomography (CT) scans were also coregistered to the MRI scans. The AF was reconstructed from a region lateral to the corona radiata on the FA map. Colocalization, defined as <1 cm between the AF and the electrode positions delineating language cortex, was visually assessed with excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.98). Result(s): Atotal of 71 subdural grid contacts were overlying language cortex. Nineteen contacts in eight patients were over Broca's area, 16 of which (84.2%) colocalized with the AF. Fifty-two contacts in 10 patients were over Wernicke's area, with colocalization in 29 patients (55.8%). Colocalization was significantly greater in anterior regions than in posterior regions [chi2(1) = 4.850, p < 0.05]. Discussion(s): The AF, as visualized with DTI, colocalized well with anterior language areas, but less so with posterior language areas, inferring that the latter are more spatially dispersed. © 2009 International League Against Epilepsy.",29,,,
86,"Objective - The precise mechanism of action of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in suppressing epileptic seizures remains to be elucidated. This study investigates whether VNS modulates cortical excitability by determining the threshold for provoking focal motor seizures by cortical electrical stimulation before and after VNS. Material and methods - Male Wistar rats (n = 8) were implanted with a cuff-electrode around the left vagus nerve and with stimulation electrodes placed bilaterally on the rat motor cortex. Motor seizure threshold (MST) was assessed for each rat before and immediately after 1 h of VNS with standard stimulation parameters, during two to three sessions on different days. Results - An overall significant increase of the MST was observed following 1 h of VNS compared to the baseline value (1420 muA and 1072 muA, respectively; P < 0.01). The effect was reproducible over time with an increase in MST in each experimental session. Conclusions - VNS significantly increases the MST in a cortical stimulation model for motor seizures. These data indicate that VNS is capable of modulating cortical excitability. © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.",0,,,1.42
87,"Background: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is a non-invasive method to localize the primary motor cortex (M1). Objective/Hypothesis: To assess the safety and feasibility of nTMS as a non-invasive preoperative mode of functional localization of M1 in epilepsy surgery candidates with intractable focal epilepsy due to lesions in the vicinity of M1. Method(s): We mapped the muscle representation areas of M1 with nTMS in 10 patients (age 2 to 55 years) with intractable epilepsy. The lesions were focal cortical dysplasia (n= 6), ganglioglioma (n= 2) polymicrogyria (n= 1) or dysembryoblastic neuroepithelial tumour (n= 1). The optimal stimulation sites and motor threshold (MT) of the distal hand or leg muscles were determined in both hemispheres. Cortical areas were mapped with stimulation intensities 100-120% of the MT to localize functional M1. Patients were on their stabile antiepileptic medication, and EEG was continuously monitored. The clinical benefit obtained with the preoperative nTMS mapping in the surgical decision making was scored as (1) essential, (2) beneficial, or (3) not beneficial, depending mainly on the difference between the functional and the presumed anatomic M1. Result(s): The M1 was successfully assessed in all but the 2 youngest patients (aged 2 and 5 years), in whom nTMS was unable to elicit motor responses. nTMS was regarded as essential or beneficial in the localization of M1 in relation to the lesions in 6 out of 10 cases. The optimal motor representation areas were mainly located symmetrically on the precentral gyrus, and corresponded to the presumed location of M1 in MRI. No clinical or EEG evidence of acute epileptogenic adverse effects were observed during the localization procedure. None of the operated patients developed post-operative motor deficits. Conclusion(s): nTMS is a safe and feasible clinical tool for the non-invasive preoperative localization of motor cortex in patients with intractable epilepsy due to focal lesions adjacent or within the presumed M1 in MRI. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",10,,,
88,"The inhibitory effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) were investigated in a rat model of kainic acid (KA)-induced limbic status epilepticus. Wistar rats were injected with 1.0 mug KA into the left amygdala after stereotactic implantation of a guide cannula and electrodes. Bipolar rectangular pulses of 0.1 msec duration and 0.1-0.3 mA amplitude were applied intermittently to the left amygdala (10 Hz or 130 Hz), left ventral hippocampus (10 Hz), and left dorsomedial thalamus (130 Hz). Seizure frequency was evaluated by video electroencephalography monitoring and compared to control animals that did not receive DBS. All rats developed limbic status epilepticus 60-90 minutes after KA injection. Seizure frequency was significantly reduced by 10 Hz stimulation of the amygdala and by 130 Hz stimulation of the dorsomedial thalamus. No significant effects were observed with other types of stimulation. Seizure behaviors or duration of seizure were not changed significantly by DBS treatment. DBS of an epileptic focus may attenuate KA-induced limbic seizures, depending on the stimulation sites and parameters.",0,,,0.3

90,"Up to now, vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has been the main therapeutic stimulation approach in patients with therapy-refractory epilepsy who are not candidates for resective surgery. Based on the extensive experience available with the treatment of movement disorders, chronic high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) may also be effective in patients with refractory epilepsy. A benefit is expected in epilepsy because of the connections that exist between the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the superior colliculus (dorsal midbrain anticonvulsant zone). Individual case reports of successful DBS in different types of epilepsy have already been presented. Our group has meanwhile experience with five adult patients (four males, 28 - 33 years) with progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndromes PMES)who underwent chronic high-frequency DBS according to a study protocol that had been approved by the local ethical commission. Electrodes were implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the first patient and additionally in the anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) bilaterally in the following four cases. The DBS effects were compared with the baseline Video-EEG findings concerning myoclonic jerk and daily life performance eight weeks prior to the implantation and threemonthly afterwards. No complications occurred. The best effects were seen with STN but not with ATN stimulation in all patients. In the four patients with a sufficient follow-up reduction of myoclonic seizures by more than 50% was documented by video and by self-reports. All patients reported clinically relevant improvements of various capabilities such as free standing and walking or siginificantly improved fine motor abilities.

91,"Purpose: To determinate the effects of low frequency (0.5 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the seizure frequency and EEG power spectrum in patients with focal epilepsy. Method(s): Six patients with focal epilepsy were studied (mean age 30.66 +/- 10.26 years). Five daily sessions of 30 minutes of (rTMS) with 900 pulses each session, intensity of 110% of motor resting thershold and 0.5 Hz frequency were carried out. The rTMS was made with eight rounded coil over the irritative zone. We register the seizure frequency before, during and 1 month after the rTMS. A 19 lead EEG was recorded before and after stimulation. Changes in power spectrum before and after of rTMS were evaluated. Result(s): Before of rTMS the mean seizure frequency was 2.87, during rTMS 0.83 (71.08%, p=0.20) and one month after rTMS 1.30 (54.7%, p=0.13). In stimulated region the mean power of delta band before of rTMS was of 10.23 +/- 7.92 muV2, in theta band 9.79 +/- 5.85 muV2, in the alpha band 28 +/- 40.67 muV2 and beta band 2.91 +/- 1.67 muV2. After of rTMS the mean power of delta was of 11.36 +/- 8.48 muV2, theta 9.59 +/- 5.17 muV2, alpha 24.79 +/- 35.37 muV2 and beta 2.69 +/- 1.22 muV2 (p> 0.05).

92,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a widely used surgical procedure for the treatment of patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) and several anatomical target have been described. Indications for DBS includes patients with focal, partial seizure and those for which resective or disconnective surgery are contraindicated, such as involvement of eloquent cortex or significant comorbidities. Despite the SANTE trial has clearly indicated the efficacy of DBS of anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT), specific indications regarding the best anatomical target and outcome in patients with severe disability are lacking. Here we described our case series of patients underwent DBS of three different target including ANT, centromedian thalamic nucleus (CMN) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Method(s): Six patients with DRE have been treated with DBS of ANT (n = 3), STN (n = 2) and CMN (n = 1). Outcome has been expressed as seizures frequency reduction and patients functional status after surgery with a follow-up of 5-11 years. Result(s): Four out of six patients show no reduction of seizures frequency after DBS implant with one case of increasing atypical absence. Two cases, one ANT and one CMN, show a significant reduction of seizures frequency of 50-60%. No patients improve relative to functional outcome and one showed psychiatric symptoms worsening. Conclusion(s): For patients with DRE and severe functional disability, DBS may reduce seizure frequency in some cases, but it does not improve functional outcome.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",6,,,
93,"Introduction: Following electrode implantation, a subgroup of patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for focal epilepsy exhibits a reduction of seizure frequency before stimulation is initiated. Microlesioning of the target structure has been postulated to be the cause of this ""insertional"" effect (IE). We examined the occurrence and duration of this IE in a group of patients with focal epilepsy following electrode implantation in the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT) and/or nucleus accumbens (NAC) for DBS treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): Changes in monthly seizure frequency compared to preoperative baseline were assessed one month (14 patients) and five months (four patients) after electrode implantation. A group analysis between patients with implantation of bilateral ANT-electrodes (four patients), NAC-electrodes (one patient) as well as ANT and NAC-electrodes (nine patients) was performed. Result(s): In this cohort, seizure frequency decreased one month after electrode implantation by 57.1 +/- 30.1%, p <= 0.001 (compared to baseline). No significant difference within stimulation target subcohorts was found (p > 0.05). Out of the four patients without stimulation for five months following electrode insertion, three patients showed seizure frequency reduction lasting two to three months, while blinded to their stimulation status. Conclusion(s): An IE might explain seizure frequency reduction in our cohort. This effect seems to be independent of the number of implanted electrodes and of the target itself. The time course of the blinded subgroup of epilepsy patients suggests a peak of the lesional effect at two to three months after electrode insertion.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

94,"Objective: It remains unclear whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can replace the Wada test to determine language hemisphere dominance (HD). Using the Wada test as the gold standard, this study aimed to investigate the accuracy of navigated TMS (nTMS) in determining language HD. Method(s): This study enrolled nine right-handed patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We hypothesized that application of nTMS to language-related areas of the language-dominant hemisphere would induce positive manifestation of language dysfunction (LD). To test our hypothesis, the patients were instructed to perform a visual object-naming task while nTMS was applied to the anterior (e.g., Broca's area) and posterior (e.g., Wernicke's area) regions, which are closely related to language processing. The Wada test result was used as the gold standard, and the diagnostic value of nTMS was assessed using the Kappa consistency test. Result(s): The nTMS-induced LD positive rate for the bilateral anterior language areas (85.7%) was higher than that for the posterior language areas (57.1%). There was high consistency between nTMS stimulation of the left anterior and posterior language areas and the Wada test results for determining language HD. In contrast, the consistency of stimulation of the right anterior and posterior transfer sites was moderate (Kappa value = 0.545, P = 0.171) and low, respectively. For the latter, no statistical calculation was performed because stimulation of the right posterior speech area was negative in all patients compared with the Wada test results. Conclusion(s): Our findings revealed that using nTMS to stimulate language-related left anterior and posterior areas could predict language HD with high accuracy. When the stimulation performance of these areas is positive, nTMS and the Wada test are equally accurate. Observing only negative performance may indicate that language HD has been transferred to the right side.Copyright © 2020",9,,,
95,"Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million people worldwide, and it is a significant contributor to the global burden of neurological disorders. Despite the advent of new AEDs, drug resistant-epilepsy continues to affect 30-40% of PWE. Once identified as having drug-resistant epilepsy, these patients should be referred to a comprehensive epilepsy center for evaluation to establish if they are candidates for potential curative surgeries. Unfortunately, a large proportion of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy are poor surgical candidates due to a seizure focus located in eloquent cortex, multifocal epilepsy or inability to identify the zone of ictal onset. An alternative treatment modality for these patients is neuromodulation. Here we present the evidence, indications and safety considerations for the neuromodulation therapies in vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), responsive neurostimulation (RNS), or deep brain stimulation (DBS).Copyright © 2021 Rincon N et al.",0,,,
96,"Introduction: Nearly 25% of all epilepsy is Drug Resistant Epilepsy (DRE) 1-3. Surgical evaluation should be considered early in the course of the disease to minimize morbidity and the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)4-5. Neuromodulation is a viable option when resection or ablation is not feasible. A growing body of evidence shows improved seizure control and long-term efficacy with both7. With highly complex epileptogenic networks, a multimodality approach may provide an additional benefit to maximize seizure control. We report two cases of DRE who underwent anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) DBS implantation followed by RNS implantation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of simultaneous DBS and RNS neurostimulation for the treatment of epilepsy. Method(s): A retrospective chart review was performed on 2 patients with DRE receiving care at Spectrum Health Medical Group who underwent ANT DBS followed by RNS implantation in select targets based on pre-surgical evaluation. Demographic, radiographic, electroencephalographic (EEG), stimulation parameter and follow-up data were abstracted and are summarized in table 1. Seizure frequency and severity were assessed at follow up. Result(s): Patient 1: She underwent left ANT DBS followed by left hippocampus and periventricular heterotopia depth electrode RNS. Pre-implantation she experienced 1-5 focal impaired awareness seizures (FIAS) per month. After being seizure-free for 3 months post-implantation, she experienced 2 focal aware seizures (FAS). She reported a seizure reduction frequency at 7-month follow-up of 25-49% as well as decreased severity. Patient 2: She underwent implantation of bilateral ANT DBS followed by bilateral hippocampal depth electrode RNS. Prior to surgery she reported 3 different seizure semiology patterns, including FAS with a frequency of 1 per month, 2 FIAS in 2019 and 1 focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (FBTCS). She was seizure-free at 6-month follow up. Conclusion(s): DRE poses a challenging problem in which only 20% of patients are surgical candidates, and of these, only 30-40% achieve benefit. Neuromodulation techniques, such as DBS and RNS, have proven efficacious and safe in randomized controlled trials7-9. This is particularly important in cases of multiple epileptogenic foci, diffuse onset epilepsy or if resective surgery is not an option. Whether the optimal stimulation pathways will be thalamic, cortical, or corticothalamic, remains to be seen; and whether a combination of closed loop and open loop stimulation will be synergistic also awaits further experience. Nevertheless, these cases illustrated that RNS and DBS implantation in the same patient is feasible, safe and potentially effective.",2,,,
97,"OBJECTIVE: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is a noninvasive technique often used for localization of the functional motor cortex via induction of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in neurosurgical patients. There has, however, been no published record of its application in pediatric epilepsy surgery. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the feasibility of nTMS-based motor mapping in the preoperative diagnostic workup within a population of children with medically refractory epilepsy. METHOD(S): A single-institution database was screened for preoperative nTMS motor mappings obtained in pediatric patients (aged 0 to 18 years, 2012 to present) with medically refractory epilepsy. Patient clinical data, demographic information, and mapping results were extracted and used in statistical analyses. RESULT(S): Sixteen patients met the inclusion criteria, 15 of whom underwent resection. The median age was 9 years (range 0-17 years). No adverse effects were recorded during mapping. Specifically, no epileptic seizures were provoked via nTMS. Recordings of valid MEPs induced by nTMS were obtained in 10 patients. In the remaining patients, no MEPs could be elicited. Failure to generate MEPs was associated significantly with younger patient age (r = 0.8020, p = 0.0001863). The most frequent seizure control outcome was Engel Epilepsy Surgery Outcome Scale class I (9 patients). CONCLUSION(S): Navigated TMS is a feasible, effective, and well-tolerated method for mapping the motor cortex of the upper and lower extremities in pediatric patients with epilepsy. Patient age modulates elicitability of MEPs, potentially reflecting various stages of myelination. Successful motor mapping has the potential to add to the existing presurgical diagnostic workup in this population, and further research is warranted.",16,,,
98,"Objective: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is becoming increasingly popular in noninvasive preoperative language mapping, as its results correlate well enough with those obtained by direct cortical stimulation (DCS) during awake surgery in adult patients with tumor. Reports in the context of epilepsy surgery or extraoperative DCS in adults are, however, sparse, and validation of nTMS with DCS in children is lacking. Furthermore, little is known about the risk of inducing epileptic seizures with nTMS in pediatric epilepsy patients. We provide the largest validation study to date in an epilepsy surgery population. Method(s): We compared language mapping with nTMS and extraoperative DCS in 20 epilepsy surgery patients (age range 9-32 years; 14 children and adolescents). Result(s): In comparison with DCS, sensitivity of nTMS was 68%, specificity 76%, positive predictive value 27%, and negative predictive value 95%. Age, location of ictal-onset zone near or within DCS-mapped language areas or severity of cognitive deficits had no significant effect on these values. None of our patients had seizures during nTMS. Significance: Our study suggests that nTMS language mapping is clinically useful and safe in epilepsy surgery patients, including school-aged children and patients with extensive cognitive dysfunction. Similar to in tumor surgery, mapping results in the frontal region are most reliable. False negative findings may be slightly more likely in epilepsy than in tumor surgery patients. Mapping results should always be verified by other methods in individual patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

99,"Background and aims: The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) in drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients was demonstrated in the double-blind Stimulation of the Anterior Nucleus of the Thalamus for Epilepsy (SANTE) randomized controlled trial. The Medtronic Registry for Epilepsy (MORE) aims to understand the safety and longerterm effectiveness of ANT-DBS therapy in routine clinical practice. Method(s): MORE is an observational registry collecting prospective and retrospective clinical data. Participants were at least 18 years old, with focal DRE recruited across 25 sites from 13 countries. They were followed for at least two years in terms of seizure frequency (SF), health-related quality of life (Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory 31 (QOLIE-31), depression, and safety outcomes. Outcomes in the complete case population at two years are reported. Result(s): Of the 191 patients recruited, 170 (mean age of 35.6 years, 43% female) were analysed. At entry, 38% of patients reported cognitive impairment. Over two years the median monthly SF decreased progressively by 33,1% (p-value<0.0001) and QOLIE-31 improved by a median 2-point. No change in depression severity was seen. Factors influencing SF reduction included seizure type, absence of cognitive impairment and site implant volume. The most reported adverse events were new or worsening seizures (16% of patients), memory impairment (15%) and depression (13%). Conclusion(s): The MORE registry supports the benefit and safety of ANT-DBS therapy in a real-world setting in the 2-years following implantation. Patients without cognitive impairment may benefit more from this type of neuromodulation therapy.",191,,,
100,"Background and Introduction: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been increasingly used in the treatment of refractory epilepsy with remarkable safety. Experimental data demonstrated that electric current could modulate distinct brain circuits and decrease neuronal hypersynchronization seen in epileptic activity. The ability to carefully choose the most suitable anatomical target and precisely implant the lead is of extreme importance for satisfactory outcomes. Objective(s): This video aimed to explore the targeting of the three most relevant nuclei in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Technique: Through a step-by-step approach, this video describes the surgical planning for DBS implantation in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT), the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CM), and the hippocampus (HIP). Conclusion(s): Each of the discussed targets has its own pearls and pitfalls that should be considered for an adequate lead placement. Accurate planning of the surgical procedure is essential for achieving optimal results.",0,,,
101,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and anterior thalamic deep brain stimulation (ANT-DBS) have both been used for treatments of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, there is no comparative study on the effectiveness of two methods from one single center. 17 patients with DRE who underwent VNS therapy and 18 patients who underwent DBS were enrolled. A retrospective study was performed starting from baseline before operation extending to 12 months after operation. The seizure types, duration of epilepsy, age at implantation, failed numbers of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) before operation, history of craniotomy, stimulation parameters and response rate were described. The analysis of liner regression on the age of onset, duration of epilepsy, numbers of AEDs, and the seizure reduction at 12 months after operation was applied. The mean seizure reduction in patients with DBS at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the operation was 57.22%, 61.61%, 63.94% and 65.28%, and that in cases with VNS was 36.06%, 39.94%, 45.24% and 48.35%, respectively. At 1 year after the operation, the patients with older operation age, focal seizures and older age of onset responded better to VNS; and those older operation age, focal generalized seizures, history of craniotomy and longer duration of disease responded better to DBS. The efficiency of ANT-DBS was higher than that of VNS at each follow up time point. Patients can choose the appropriate treatment according to the individual clinical characteristics.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",18,,,
102,"Introduction ?Deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT DBS) is a neuromodulation therapy for patients with refractory partial seizures. The ANT is the structure of a limbic system with abundant neuronal connections to temporal and frontal brain regions that participate in seizure propagation circuitry. State of the Art ?We have performed a literature search regarding the clinical efficacy of ANT DBS. We discuss the surgical technique of the implantation of DBS electrodes with special attention paid to the targeting methods of the ANT. Moreover, we present in detail the clinical efficacy of ANT DBS, with a special emphasis on the stimulation parameters, a stimulation mode, and polarity. We also report all adverse events and present the current limitations of ANT DBS. Clinical Implications ?In general, the safety profile of DBS in intractable epilepsy patients is good, with a low rate of surgery, hardware-related, and stimulation-induced adverse events. No significant cognitive declines or worsening of depressive symptoms was noted. At long-term follow-up, the quality-of-life scores have improved. The limitations of ANT DBS studies include a limited number of patients treated and mostly open-label designs with only one double-blind, randomized multicenter trial. Most studies do not report the etiology of intractable epilepsy or they include nonhomogeneous groups of patients affected by intractable epilepsy. There are no guidelines for setting initial stimulation parameters. All the variables mentioned may have a profound impact on the final outcome. Conclusions ?ANT DBS appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment, particularly in patients with refractory partial seizures (three-quarters of patients gained at least 50% seizure reduction after 5 years). ANT DBS reduces most effectively the seizures originating in the temporal and frontal lobes. The published results of ANT DBS highlight promise and hope for patients with intractable epilepsy.Copyright © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.",0,,,
103,"Background: Post-hypoxic myoclonus (PHM) is characterized by generalized myoclonus after hypoxic brain injury. Myoclonus is often functionally impairing and refractory to medical therapies. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to treat myoclonus-dystonia, but few cases of PHM have been described. Case report: A 33-year-old woman developed severe, refractory generalized myoclonus after cardiopulmonary arrest from drowning. We performed MRI-guided asleep bilateral pallidal DBS placement, resulting in improvement in action myoclonus at one year. Discussion(s): Our case contributes to growing evidence for DBS for PHM. Interventional MRI guided DBS technique can be used for safe and accurate lead placement. Highlights: We report a case of a patient who developed post-hypoxic myoclonus after cardiopulmonary arrest from drowning, who later underwent deep brain stimulation to treat refractory myoclonus. This is the first case to describe asleep, interventional MRI-guided technique for implanting DBS leads in post-hypoxic myoclonus.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",1,,,
104,"Accurate presurgical mapping of motor, speech, and language cortices, while crucial for neurosurgical planning and minimizing post-operative functional deficits, is challenging in young children with neurological disease. In such children, both invasive (cortical stimulation mapping) and non-invasive functional mapping imaging methods (MEG, fMRI) have limited success, often leading to delayed surgery or adverse post-surgical outcomes. We therefore examined the clinical utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in young children who require functional mapping. In a retrospective chart review of TMS studies performed on children with refractory epilepsy or a brain tumor, at our institution, we identified 47 mapping sessions in 36 children 3 years of age or younger, in whom upper and lower extremity motor mapping was attempted; and 13 children 5-6 years old in whom language mapping, using a naming paradigm, was attempted. The primary hand motor cortex was identified in at least one hemisphere in 33 of 36 patients, and in both hemispheres in 27 children. In 17 children, primary leg motor cortex was also successfully identified. The language cortices in temporal regions were successfully mapped in 11 of 13 patients, and in six of them language cortices in frontal regions were also mapped, with most children (n = 5) showing right hemisphere dominance for expressive language. Ten children had a seizure that was consistent with their clinical semiology during or immediately following TMS, none of which required intervention or impeded completion of mapping. Using TMS, both normal motor, speech, and language developmental patterns and apparent disease induced reorganization were demonstrated in this young cohort. The successful localization of motor, speech, and language cortices in young children improved the understanding of the risk-benefit ratio prior to surgery and facilitated surgical planning aimed at preserving motor, speech, and language functions. Post-operatively, motor function was preserved or improved in nine out of 11 children who underwent surgery, as was language function in all seven children who had surgery for lesions near eloquent cortices. We provide feasibility data that TMS is a safe, reliable, and effective tool to map eloquent cortices in young children.© Copyright © 2021 Narayana, Gibbs, Fulton, McGregor, Mudigoudar, Weatherspoon, Boop and Wheless.",36,,,
105,"Objectives: To review clinical evidence on the antiepileptic effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for drug-resistant epilepsy, its safety, and the factors influencing individual outcomes. Method(s): A comprehensive search of the medical literature (PubMed, Medline) was conducted to identify relevant articles investigating DBS therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy. Reference lists of these articles were used to source further articles. Result(s): Stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) and hippocampus (HC) has been shown to decrease the frequency of refractory seizures. Half of all patients from clinical studies experienced a 46%-90% seizure reduction with ANT-DBS, and a 48%-95% seizure reduction with HC-DBS. The efficacy of stimulating other targets remains inconclusive due to lack of evidence. Approximately three-fourths of patients receiving ANT, HC, or centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CMT) stimulation are responders-experiencing a seizure reduction of at least 50%. The time course of clinical benefit varies dramatically, with both an initial lesional effect and ongoing stimulation effect at play. Improved quality of life and changes to cognition or mood may also occur. Side effects are similar in nature to those reported from DBS therapy for movement disorders. Several factors are potentially associated with stimulation efficacy, including an absence of structural abnormality on imaging for ANT and HC stimulation, and electrode position relative to the target. Certain seizure types or syndromes may respond more favorably to specific targets, including ANT stimulation for deep temporal or limbic seizures, and CMT stimulation for generalized seizures and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Significance: We have identified several patient, disease, and stimulation factors that potentially predict seizure outcome following DBS. More large-scale clinical trials are needed to explore different stimulation parameters, reevaluate the indications for DBS, and identify robust predictors of patient response.Copyright Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2017 International League Against Epilepsy",0,,,
106,"Background and Objectives: Managing refractory Post-hypoxic myoclonus can be extremely challenging. PHM can cause debilitating functional disabilities with pharmacological options limited to benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants. Deep brain stimulation is a well-accepted treatment for movement disorders like myoclonus-dystonia, Parkinson's disease and essential tremors. Emerging case reports suggest DBS to be a viable therapeutic option for refractory PHM. Method(s): A systematic search adhering to PRISMA guidelines was performed from electronic databases (Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library) from inception until 18th October 2020. Renowned preprint servers like medRxiv, bioRxiv were also searched. Published case-reports/ series of refractory PHM were included. Pre and postoperative Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale scores & DBS programming parameters were compared. Result(s): Eight patients were identified. Mean age was 47.3+/-19.6 years with a male to female ratio of 5:3. Cardiopulmonary arrest was of common occurrence. DBS targeting the globus pallidus internus was reported in 75% cases; one being MRI guided, thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus in 12.5% and both Gpi & Vim in another 12.5% of cases. Mean Amplitude of 2.7 V, pulse width 80 mus and frequency 130 Hz were needed for achieving therapeutic responses. There was 100% improvement in myoclonus at rest and >70% improvement in 62.5% cases with the remaining 37.5% showing 36% improvement in action myoclonus. Infection of IPG was reported in one case. Voxel-based PET analysis was used for monitoring. Conclusion(s): A robust improvement has been demonstrated. Globus pallidus internus is the most optimal target site for DBS. With a small cohort of published cases, it is reasonable to consider DBS as a potential effective treatment for intractable PHM. With technological advances like interventional MRI and PET analysis, application of DBS to manage rare myoclonus disorders will continue to grow. Further studies are warranted to elucidate its efficacy and support refractory-myoclonus treatment paradigms.",8,,2.7,
107,"We hypothesized that local/regional properties of stimulated structure/circuitry contribute to the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS). We analyzed intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from externalized DBS electrodes targeted bilaterally in the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT) in 12 patients (six responders, six nonresponders) with more than 1 year of follow-up care. In the bipolar local field potentials of the EEG, spectral power (PW) and power spectral entropy (PSE) were calculated in the passbands 1-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-20, 20-45, 65-80, 80-200 and 200-500 Hz. The most significant differences between responders and nonresponders were observed in the BRIDGE area (bipolar recordings with one contact within the ANT and the second contact in adjacent tissue). In responders, PW was significantly decreased in the frequency bands of 65-80, 80-200, and 200-500 Hz (p <.05); PSE was significantly increased in all frequency bands (p <.05) except for 200-500 Hz (p =.06). The local EEG characteristics of ANT recorded after implantation may play a significant role in DBS response prediction.Copyright © 2021 International League Against Epilepsy",12,,,
108,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS), specifically thalamic DBS, has achieved promising results to reduce seizure severity and frequency in pharmacoresistant epilepsies, thereby establishing it for clinical use. The mechanisms of action are, however, still unknown. We evidenced the brain networks directly modulated by centromedian (CM) nucleus-DBS and responsible for clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients uniquely diagnosed with generalized pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Preoperative imaging and long-term (2-11 years) clinical data from ten generalized pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients (mean age at surgery = 30.8 +/- 5.9 years, 4 female) were evaluated. Volume of tissue activated (VTA) was included as seeds to reconstruct the targeted network to thalamic DBS from diffusion and functional imaging data. CM-DBS clinical outcome improvement (> 50%) appeared in 80% of patients and was tightly related to VTAs interconnected with a reticular system network encompassing sensorimotor and supplementary motor cortices, together with cerebellum/brainstem. Despite methodological differences, both structural and functional connectomes revealed the same targeted network. Our results demonstrate that CM-DBS outcome in generalized pharmacoresistant epilepsy is highly dependent on the individual connectivity profile, involving the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits. The proposed framework could be implemented in future studies to refine stereotactic implantation or the parameters for individualized neuromodulation.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",10,,,
109,"Much attention has been dedicated to clinical research of focal epilepsy, but the ability to derive a successful seizure control strategy based on unique dynamical features of the electroencephalogram is an unsolved problem. In this work, we introduce a basic model of spontaneous seizure dynamics and construct from it to a network model of focal-onset seizure dynamics. The full model is composed of coupled oscillators with scale-free network connectivity and a common slow variable. We find that global parameter changes and variation of the connectivity can drive the model from a quiescent state to recurrent seizures, and, eventually, to a permanent-seizure-state. Based on network synchronization features we design a stimulation scheme for the control of the fraction of nodes with strongest phase locking is proposed. Simulations lead to the identification of optimal stimuli for a given type of dynamics. Our results contribute to the development of a rational strategy for the non-surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy.Copyright © 2001-2011 IEEE.",0,,,
110,"OBJECTIVE The anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) is a common target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy. However, no atlas-based optimal DBS (active contacts) target within the ATN has been definitively identified. The object of this retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between the active contact location and seizure reduction to establish an atlas-based optimal target for ATN DBS. METHODS From among 25 patients who had undergone ATN DBS surgery for drug-resistant epilepsy between 2016 and 2018, those who had follow-up evaluations for more than 1 year were eligible for study inclusion. After an initial stimulation period of 6 months, patients were classified as responsive (>= 50% median decrease in seizure frequency) or nonresponsive (< 50% median decrease in seizure frequency) to treatment. Stimulation parameters and/or active contact positions were adjusted in nonresponsive patients, and their responsiveness was monitored for at least 1 year. Postoperative CT scans were coregistered nonlinearly with preoperative MR images to determine the center coordinate and atlas-based anatomical localizations of all active contacts in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 space. RESULTS Nineteen patients with drug-resistant epilepsy were followed up for at least a year following bilateral DBS electrode implantation targeting the ATN. Active contacts located more adjacent to the center of gravity of the anterior half of the ATN volume, defined as the anterior center (AC), were associated with greater seizure reduction than those not in this location. Intriguingly, the initially nonresponsive patients could end up with much improved seizure reduction by adjusting the active contacts closer to the AC at the final postoperative follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Patients with stimulation targeting the AC may have a favorable seizure reduction. Moreover, the authors were able to obtain additional good outcomes after electrode repositioning in the initially nonresponsive patients. Purposeful and strategic trajectory planning to target this optimal region may predict favorable outcomes of ATN DBS.Copyright © AANS 2021, except where prohibited by US copyright law.",25,,,
111,"The Effects of Direct Brain Stimulation in Humans Depend on Frequency, Amplitude, and White-Matter Proximity Mohan U, Watrous A, Miller J, et al. Brain Stimul. 2020;13(5):1183-1195. doi:10.1016/j.brs.2020.05.009 Background: Researchers have used direct electrical brain stimulation to treat a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, for brain stimulation to be maximally effective, clinicians and researchers should optimize stimulation parameters according to desired outcomes. Objective(s): The goal of our large-scale study was to comprehensively evaluate the effects of stimulation at different parameters and locations on neuronal activity across the human brain. Method(s): To examine how different kinds of stimulation affect human brain activity, we compared the changes in neuronal activity that resulted from stimulation at a range of frequencies, amplitudes, and locations with direct human brain recordings. We recorded human brain activity directly with electrodes that were implanted in widespread regions across 106 neurosurgical epilepsy patients while systematically across a range of parameters and locations. Result(s): Overall, stimulation most often had an inhibitory effect on neuronal activity, consistent with earlier work. When stimulation excited neuronal activity, it most often occurred from high-frequency stimulation. These effects were modulated by the location of the stimulating electrode, with stimulation sites near white matter more likely to cause excitation and sites near gray matter more likely to inhibit neuronal activity. Conclusion(s): By characterizing how different stimulation parameters produced specific neuronal activity patterns on a large scale, our results provide an electrophysiological framework that clinicians and researchers may consider when designing stimulation protocols to cause precisely targeted changes in human brain activity.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",106,,,
112,"Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is an effective treatment for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who are unsuitable for surgical epilepsy treatment. However, the mechanism of action of VNS remains unclear, and the efficacy of VNS treatment regarding seizure frequency reduction cannot be assessed before surgery. This study measured changes in functional connectivity between thalamus and precentral gyrus which are activated as vital targets of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using resting-state functional MRI to evaluate the effects of VNS. 16 epilepsy patients who underwent VNS were collected and scanned by resting-state functional MRI before and after operation. The functional connections (regions of interest: thalamus, precentral gyrus) were examined. After three months of stimulation, there were eight responders (>=50 % seizure reduction) and eight non-responders to VNS. No significant difference in thalamus-precentral gyrus functional connectivity was found between responders and nonresponders before operation. Enhanced functional connections were observed between bilateral thalamus and bilateral precentral gyrus in responders, which decreased in nonresponders, while functional connections between bilateral thalamus decreased in both responders and nonresponders. Short-term stimulation may cause thalamus-precentral gyrus functional connectivity changes in DRE patients, and control seizures by enhancing functional connections between bilateral thalamus and bilateral precentral gyrus.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",16,,,
113,"Objective: Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) pose considerable management challenges for patients, their families, and providers. Both the vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) and the ketogenic diet (KD) have been shown to be safe and effective in treating DRE. Nevertheless, information is lacking regarding treatment with combination of both modalities. This study reports the efficacy and tolerability of combining VNS and KD in a pediatric cohort with intractable epilepsy. Method(s): This is a retrospective review of 33 patients (0-17 years) with DRE treated with VNS and KD at a single pediatric level IV epilepsy center. We compared seizure reduction rates for each patient at baseline and at every clinic visit for 24 months after adding the second nonpharmacological therapy. The frequency of adverse events on the combined therapy was collected to assess safety and tolerability. Result(s): There were a total of 170 visits for all patients while on the combined therapy. At 88% (95% CI: 83%-93%) of the visits, patients reported some reduction in seizure frequency. The proportion of patients reporting a greater than 50% seizure reduction over all visits was 62% (95% CI: 55%-69%). The proportion of a patient's visits with at least a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency had a median of 71% (IQR 33%-100%). Continued improvement was seen over time of combined treatment; for every one-unit time unit change (one month), there was a 6% increase in the odds of having a reduction in seizure frequency of >50% (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11). Significance: This study shows that combining the VNS and KD in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy is well tolerated and reduces seizure frequency more than either one modality used alone and that the benefits in terms of seizure reduction continue to increase with the length of treatment.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

114,"Impaired consciousness occurs suddenly and unpredictably in people with epilepsy, markedly worsening quality of life and increasing risk of mortality. Focal seizures with impaired consciousness are the most common form of epilepsy and are refractory to all current medical and surgical therapies in about one-sixth of cases. Restoring consciousness during and following seizures would be potentially transformative for these individuals. Here, we investigate deep brain stimulation to improve level of conscious arousal in a rat model of focal limbic seizures. We found that dual-site stimulation of the central lateral nucleus of the intralaminar thalamus (CL) and the pontine nucleus oralis (PnO) bilaterally during focal limbic seizures restored normal-appearing cortical electrophysiology and markedly improved behavioral arousal. In contrast, single-site bilateral stimulation of CL or PnO alone was insufficient to achieve the same result. These findings support the ""network inhibition hypothesis"" that focal limbic seizures impair consciousness through widespread inhibition of subcortical arousal. Driving subcortical arousal function would be a novel therapeutic approach to some forms of refractory epilepsy and may be compatible with devices already in use for responsive neurostimulation. Multisite deep brain stimulation of subcortical arousalstructures may benefit not only patients with epilepsy but also those with other disorders of consciousness.Copyright © 2017 Oxford University Press.

115,"Up to one-third of all patients with epilepsy have epilepsy refractory to medical therapy. Surgical options include temporal lobectomy, focal neocortical resection, stereotactic lesioning and neurostimulation. Neurostimulatory options comprise vagal nerve stimulation, trigeminal nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS enables structures in the brain to be stimulated electrically by an implanted pacemaker after a minimally invasive neurosurgical procedure and has become the therapy of choice for Parkinson's disease refractory to or complicated by drug therapy. Here we review DBS for epilepsy, a powerful emerging treatment in the surgical armamentarium for drug refractory epilepsy, with a focus on extratemporal epilepsy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

116,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) consists of the electrical stimulation of the subcortical structures by implanting electrodes connected to a pulse generator. The thalamus, being a structure that has multiple connections with various parts of the central nervous system, is a suitable target for DBS. The anterior thalamic nucleus (ANT) serves as an important relay site for the limbic system by receiving input from the hippocampus and mammillary bodies, and sending input to the cingulate gyrus; thus forming the Papez circuit. Due to these connections, the ANT constitutes an ideal route for the propagation of epileptogenic activity. ANT-DBS has excellent results in the control of complex partial seizures. The vast majority of patients with ANT-DBS have shown a significant reduction in the frequency of their seizures of more than 50%.Copyright © 2021",0,,,
117,"Objective: To investigate the effect of three months of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment in intractable epilepsy. Method(s): Five patients (four males, one female; ages 6 to 50 years), were enrolled in the study; their epilepsy could not be controlled by medical treatment and surgery was not indicated. rTMS was performed twice a week for three months; patients kept records of seizure frequency for an equal period of time before, during, and after rTMS sessions. rTMS was delivered to the vertex with a round coil, at an intensity 5% below motor threshold. During rTMS sessions, 100 stimuli (five series of 20 stimuli, with one-minute intervals between series) were delivered at a frequency of 0.3 Hz. Result(s): Mean daily number of seizures (MDNS) decreased in three patients and increased in two during rTMS- one of these was treated for only one month; the best result was achieved in a patient with focal cortical dysplasia (reduction of 43.09% in MDNS). In the whole patient group, there was a significant (p<0.01) decrease in MDNS of 22.8%. Conclusion(s): Although prolonged rTMS treatment is safe and moderately decreases MDNS in a group of patients with intractable epilepsy, individual patient responses were mostly subtle and clinical relevance of this method is probably low. Our data suggest, however, that patients with focal cortical lesions may indeed benefit from this novel treatment. Further studies should concentrate on that patient subgroup.",5,,,
118,"Prior studies have used functional neuroimaging to demonstrate that the organization of the autistic brain is different from that of the non-autistic brain. Similarly, patients with epilepsy have also shown cortical reorganization. We present a case study that provides direct confirmation of disorganized sensorimotor distribution in a patient with autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. To our knowledge, this is the first time cortical mapping directly showing abnormal cortical organization in a patient with autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy has been reported in the literature.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",1,,,
119,"Background: Status epilepticus (SE) and super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) are life-threatening medical emergencies. The first-line treatment for SE or SRSE includes i. v. anesthetic agents with respiratory support, AEDs, and steroids. Surgical interventions are indicated if medical treatments fail to abrupt the seizures. Apart from resective epilepsy surgery employed for the treatment of SE and SRSE, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of thalamic nuclei is aimed at directly influencing the brain function. Objective(s): The main objective of this review is to present the efficacy and safety of DBS in SE and SRSE in humans. Method(s): We performed the literature search regarding DBS therapy in the treatment of SE and SRSE. All manuscripts written in English have been analyzed and included in this review. Result(s): We were able to find 7 case reports describing DBS outcomes for the treatment of SE or SRSE in 8 patients. Six patients operated for SE or SRSE gained a significant seizure reduction or total abolition of seizures. One patient due to an infection and the other one due to a stimulation-related adverse event required the total DBS hardware removal. Conclusion(s): Case reports suggest that DBS can be considered as one of the treatment choices in SE and SRSE cases. A small number of treated cases and various thalamic nuclei targeted by DBS electrodes preclude drawing definitive conclusions. It can be speculated that a shorter duration of refractory SE or SRSE before a DBS procedure may efficiently reduce seizure frequency.Copyright © 2020 British Epilepsy Association",8,,,
120,"Objective: To assess functional organization of the motor cortex in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1A) using a combined neurophysiologic and imaging approach. Method(s): EPM1A patients underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-based cortical mapping of the motor hand area. Moreover, they performed neuroimaging studies to assess functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation maps related to motor hand task and cortical thickness (CTH) on T1-weighted 3D images. Result(s): The hand cortical representation was different in EPM1A patients from that of the control subjects both in TMS and in fMRI brain mapping, characterized by a posterior dislocation and a mild reduction in the activation of motor areas. CTH analysis revealed a thinning of both precentral and paracentral areas in the patients. Conclusion(s): We hypothesize that the altered cortical motor map reflects a functional reorganization of the residual cortical neuronal pool of the sensorimotor hand areas driven by plastic reorganization and/or pathophysiological mechanisms. Significance: Both pathophysiological process and plastic changes may represent two sides of the same phenomenon in the EPM1A patients; structural and functional brain mapping may help to identify functional reorganization of the cortical motor system.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",0,,,
121,"Objective: We aimed to assess the roles of the cortex and thalamus (centromedian nucleus [CM]) during epileptic activity in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery as part of the ESTEL (Electrical Stimulation of the Thalamus for Epilepsy of Lennox-Gastaut Phenotype) trial. Method(s): Twelve LGS patients (mean age = 26.8 years) underwent bilateral CM-DBS implantation. Intraoperatively, simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded (range = 10-34 minutes) from scalp electrodes and bilateral thalamic DBS electrodes. Temporal onsets of epileptic discharges (generalized paroxysmal fast activity [GPFA] and slow spike-and-wave [SSW]) were manually marked on recordings from scalp (ie, ""cortex"") and thalamus (ie, CM-DBS electrodes). Phase transfer entropy (PTE) analysis quantified the degree of information transfer from cortex to thalamus within different frequency bands around GPFA events. Result(s): GPFA was captured in eight of 12 patients (total event number across patients = 168, cumulative duration = 358 seconds). Eighty-six percent of GPFA events were seen in both scalp and thalamic recordings. In most events (83%), onset occurred first at scalp, with thalamic onset lagging by a median of 98 milliseconds (interquartile range = 78.5 milliseconds). Results for SSW were more variable and seen in 11 of 12 patients; 25.4% of discharges were noted in both scalp and thalamus. Of these, 74.5% occurred first at scalp, with a median lag of 75 milliseconds (interquartile range = 228 milliseconds). One to 0.5 seconds and 0.5-0 seconds before GPFA onset, PTE analysis showed significant energy transfer from scalp to thalamus in the delta (1-3 Hz) frequency band. For alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequencies, PTE was greatest 1-0.5 seconds before GPFA onset. Significance: Epileptic activity is detectable in CM of thalamus, confirming that this nucleus participates in the epileptic network of LGS. Temporal onset of GPFA mostly occurs earlier at the scalp than in the thalamus. This supports our prior EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging results and provides further evidence for a cortically driven process underlying GPFA in LGS.Copyright © 2020 International League Against Epilepsy",12,,,
122,"Purpose:Children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes have rare seizures emerging from the motor cortex, which they outgrow in adolescence, and additionally may have language deficits of unclear etiology. We piloted the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation paired with EMG and EEG (TMS-EMG, TMS-EEG) to test the hypotheses that net cortical excitability decreases with age and that use-dependent plasticity predicts learning. Method(s):We assessed language and motor learning in 14 right-handed children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. We quantified two TMS metrics of left motor cortex excitability: the resting motor threshold (measure of neuronal membrane excitability) and amplitude of the N100-evoked potential (an EEG measure of GABAergic tone). To test plasticity, we applied 1 Hz repetitive TMS to the motor cortex to induce long-term depression-like changes in EMG- and EEG-evoked potentials. Result(s):Children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes tolerate TMS; no seizures were provoked. Resting motor threshold decreases with age but is elevated above maximal stimulator output for half the group. N100 amplitude decreases with age after controlling for resting motor threshold. Motor cortex plasticity correlates significantly with language learning and at a trend level with motor learning. Conclusion(s):Transcranial magnetic stimulation is safe and feasible for children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and TMS-EEG provides more reliable outcome measures than TMS-EMG in this group because many children have unmeasurably high resting motor thresholds. Net cortical excitability decreases with age, and motor cortex plasticity predicts not only motor learning but also language learning, suggesting a mechanism by which motor cortex seizures may interact with language development.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

123,"Objective: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive procedure, stimulates the cortex evaluating the central motor pathways. The response is called motor evoked potential (MEP). Polyphasia results when the response crosses the baseline more than twice (zero crossing). Recent research shows MEP polyphasia in patients with generalized genetic epilepsy (GGE) and their first-degree relatives compared with controls. Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME), a GGE type, is not well studied regarding polyphasia. In our study, we assessed polyphasia appearance probability with TMS in JME patients, their healthy first-degree relatives and controls. Two genetic approaches were applied to uncover genetic association with polyphasia. Method(s): 20 JME patients, 23 first-degree relatives and 30 controls underwent TMS, obtaining 10-15 MEPs per participant. We evaluated MEP mean number of phases, proportion of MEP trials displaying polyphasia for each subject and variability between groups. Participants underwent whole exome sequencing (WES) via trio-based analysis and two-case scenario. Extensive bioinformatics analysis was applied. Result(s): We identified increased polyphasia in patients (85%) and relatives (70%) compared to controls (47%) and significantly higher mean number of zero crossings (i.e., occurrence of phases) (patients 1.49, relatives 1.46, controls 1.22; p < 0.05). Trio-based analysis revealed a candidate polymorphism, p.Glu270del,in SYT14 (Synaptotagmin 14), in JME patients and their relatives presenting polyphasia. Sanger sequencing analysis in remaining participants showed no significant association. In two-case scenario, a machine learning approach was applied in variants identified from odds ratio analysis and risk prediction scores were obtained for polyphasia. The results revealed 61 variants of which none was associated with polyphasia. Risk prediction scores indeed showed lower probability for non-polyphasic subjects on having polyphasia and higher probability for polyphasic subjects on having polyphasia. Conclusion(s): Polyphasia was present in JME patients and relatives in contrast to controls. Although no known clinical symptoms are linked to polyphasia this neurophysiological phenomenon is likely due to common cerebral electrophysiological abnormality. We did not discover direct association between genetic variants obtained and polyphasia. It is likely these genetic traits alone cannot provoke polyphasia, however, this predisposition combined with disturbed brain-electrical activity and tendency to generate seizures may increase the risk of developing polyphasia, mainly in patients and relatives.© Copyright © 2020 Stefani, Kousiappa, Nicolaou, Papathanasiou, Oulas, Fanis, Neocleous, Phylactou, Spyrou and Papacostas.",20,,,
124,"Objective: We report on the seizure frequency and attention outcome during thalamic centromedian stimulation (CM-DBS) in patients with refractory generalized epilepsy (GE). Method(s): Twenty consecutive patients with GE who were submitted to CM-DBS and had at least one year of follow-up were prospectively studied. The CM was targeted bilaterally. Stimulation intensity was ramped up (bipolar, continuous, 130 Hz; 300musec) until 4.5 V or until side effects developed. Contacts' position was determined on postoperative volumetric MRI scans. Attention was qualitatively evaluated using the SNAP-IV (Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham) questionnaire. Patients were considered responders during CM-DBS if an at least 50% seizure frequency reduction was obtained compared to baseline. Result(s): Median age was 15.5 years (13 males). Median follow-up time was 2.55 years. EEG disclosed generalized spike-and wave discharges in all patients. MRI was normal in 10 patients, showed diffuse atrophy in 6 patients, and showed abnormalities in 4 patients (3 patients had bilateral cortical development abnormalities and one had unilateral hemispheric atrophy). Patients presented with daily multiple seizure types (8 to 66 per day; median: 37), including tonic, atonic, myoclonic, atypical absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Mean DBS intensity was 4.3 V. An insertional effect was noted in 14 patients. CM-DBS was able to significantly reduce the frequency of tonic (p < 0.001), atypical absence seizures (p < 0.001), atonic seizures (p = 0.001) and bilateral generalized tonic-clonic seizures (p = 0.004). One patient became seizure-free. Ninety percent of the patients were considered responders (>50% seizure frequency reduction). All patients showed some improvement in attention. The mean number of items in which improvement was noted in the SNAP-IV questionnaire was 4.8. There was a significant relationship between overall seizure frequency reduction and improvement of attention (p = 0.033). Discussion(s): This prospective, open label study included a large, homogeneous cohort and provided evidence on the efficacy of CM-DBS in reducing the seizure burden and increasing attention in patients with refractory generalized epilepsy.Copyright © 2020 British Epilepsy Association",20,,4.5,
125,"Objective: The aim of the study was to determine if corticothalamic responsive stimulation targeting the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CMT) is a potential treatment for neocortical epilepsies with regional onsets. Method(s): We assessed efficacy and safety of CMT and neocortical responsive stimulation, detection, and stimulation programming, methods for implantation, and location and patterns of electrographic seizure onset and spread in 7 patients with medically intractable focal seizures with a regional neocortical onset. Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 17 months (average: 17 months, range: 8-28 months). The median % reduction in disabling seizures (excludes auras) in the 7 patients was 88% (mean: 80%, range: 55-100%). The median % reduction in all seizure types (disabling + auras) was 73% (mean: 67%, range: 15-94%). There were no adverse events related to implantation of the responsive neurostimulator and leads or related to the delivery of responsive stimulation. Stimulation-related contralateral paresthesias were addressed by adjusting stimulation parameters in the clinic during stimulation testing. Electrographic seizures were detected in the CMT and neocortex in all seven patients. Four patients had simultaneous or near simultaneous seizure onsets in the neocortex and CMT and three had onsets in the neocortex with spread to the CMT. Conclusion(s): In this small series of patients with medically intractable focal seizures and regional neocortical onset, responsive neurostimulation to the neocortex and CMT improved seizure control and was well tolerated. Significance: Responsive corticothalamic neurostimulation of the CMT and neocortex is a potential treatment for patients with regional neocortical epilepsies.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",7,,,
126,"Introduction: Although deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS) represents an established third-line therapy for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, guiding reports on practical treatment principles remain scarce. Method(s): An Expert Panel (EP) of 10 European neurologists and 4 neurosurgeons was assembled to share their experience with ANT-DBS therapy. The process included a review of the current literature, which served as a basis for an online survey completed by the EP prior to and following a face-to-face meeting (Delphi method). An agreement level of >=71 % was considered as consensus. Result(s): Out of 86 reviewed studies, 46 (53 %) were selected to extract information on the most reported criteria for patient selection, management, and outcome. The Delphi process yielded EP consensus on 4 parameters for selection of good candidates and patient management as well as 7 reasons of concern for this therapy. Since it was not possible to give strict device programming advice due to low levels of evidence, the experts shared their clinical practice: all of them start with monopolar stimulation, 79 % using the cycling mode. Most (93 %) EP members set the initial stimulation frequency and pulse width according to the SANTE parameters, while there is more variability in the amplitudes used. Further agreement was achieved on a list of 7 patient outcome parameters to be monitored during the follow-up. Conclusion(s): Although current evidence is too low for definite practical guidelines, this EP report could support the selection and management of patients with ANT-DBS.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",7,,,
127,"Objectives: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) has been recognized to be an efficient treatment of refractory epilepsy (RE). However, ATN targeting is difficult and up to 8% of lead misplacement is reported. Our objective is to report our surgical procedure based on MRI targeting and our clinical results. Patients and Methods: Our first five consecutive patients (4M, 1F, mean age: 42.8 years) treated by DBS of ATN between March and October 2016 were included. The mean duration of their epilepsy was 29 years. Four patients had already vagal nerve stimulation and 2 mammillary body stimulation. Stereotactic coordinates were calculated using distal segment of mammillothalamic tract as landmark. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia with intraoperative control of lead position using a robotic 3D fluoroscopy and image fusion with the preoperative MRI. Result(s): No complications or lead misplacement was observed. The mean 3D distance between the planned target and location of the lead was 1.8 mm. Each patient was followed up at least one year (15 + 3 months). The stimulation parameters were: 140 Hz, 90 m/s and 5 Volts with one minute ON/five minutes OFF cycle. The mean reduction of seizure frequency reached -52.5% (+32.2) at 6-months but decreased to -24.5% (+65.7) at the last follow-up due to some adverse events not related to stimulation. Conclusion(s): No complication, no lead misplacement and the improvement in our first patients, previously not help by multiple medications or surgeries, are encouraging.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS",5,,,
128,"Objective Headache disorders are frequently associated with epilepsy. Some neuromodulation techniques for refractory epilepsy have been reported to positively influence the associated chronic headache. However, the exact mechanism of action of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and anterior thalamic nuclei-deep brain stimulation (ANT-DBS) on pain perception is unclear. Method We report a structured assessment of pain perception in a patient who experienced headache relief after ANT-DBS for refractory focal epilepsy and compare it with pain perception of epilepsy patients with chronic headache who were treated with and without VNS. Results The pain-associated symptoms in the ANT-DBS case were on the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS-40) subscore physiological anxiety closer to the control collective, whereas in patients with VNS, this was more likely for the PASS-40 subscores cognitive anxiety or escape and avoidance.

130,"Purpose: Despite the availability of numerous pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic antiseizure therapies, a fraction of patients with epilepsy remain refractory to current treatment options, underscoring the need for novel drugs and neuromodulatory therapies. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), coupled with either electromyography or electroencephalography, enables rapid measurement of the cortical excitation/inhibition ratio, which is pathologically shifted toward excess excitability in patients with epilepsy. In this review, we summarize: (1) TMS protocols that have been deployed to identify promising compounds in the antiepilepsy drug (AED)-development pipeline, and (2) the therapeutic potential of TMS in the treatment of drug-resistant seizures. Method(s): A focused literature review of the use of TMS in epilepsy, using a PubMed search, was performed. Over 70 articles were included that pertained to: (1) the use of TMS-EMG and TMS-EEG in elucidating the mechanisms of action of AEDs and in discovering potential new AEDs; and (2) the use of repetitive TMS in the treatment of seizures. Finding(s): Studies from the literature have reported that AEDs alter TMS-derived metrics, typically by leading to a net increase in cortical inhibition with successful therapy. Preclinical TMS work in rodent models of epilepsy has led to the development of novel antiseizure drug compounds. Clinical translational studies of TMS have been used to determine guidelines on the dosages of other agents in the AED pipeline in preparation for clinical trials. Several studies have described the use of therapeutic repetitive TMS in both the ictal and interictal states of epilepsy, with inconsistent results. Implications: TMS has diagnostic and therapeutic potential in epilepsy. TMS-derived markers can enable early-stage measures of AED target engagement, and can facilitate studies of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of AEDs. TMS may also be used in the early prediction of the efficacy of different AEDs in treating patients, and in direct neuromodulation of epileptic networks. From the therapeutics perspective, despite favorable results in some trials, the optimization of treatment paradigms and the determination of ideal candidates for TMS are still needed. Finally, preclinical experiments of TMS have provided mechanistic insight into its effects on the excitation/inhibition ratio, and may facilitate rational drug-device coupling paradigms. Overall, the capacity of TMS in both the modulation and measurement of changes in cortical excitability highlights its unique role in advancing antiepilepsy therapeuticsCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",0,,,
131,"Background: Preoperative thalamic targeting methods have historically relied on indirect targeting techniques that do not fully account for variances in anatomy or for thalamic atrophy in epilepsy. We aimed to address variability noted between traditional indirect targeting and direct targeting methods for the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT). Method(s): Fifteen consecutive patients undergoing ANT deep brain stimulator placement were evaluated (30 thalamic nuclei). Direct ANT targeting was performed using a fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery sequence and compared with standard stereotactic coordinates. Thalamic volumes were calculated for each patient, and degree of thalamic volume loss was assessed compared with matched control subjects. Vertex analysis was performed to assess shape changes in the thalamus compared with age- and sex-matched subjects. Result(s): There was significant variation between direct and indirect targets in the y-axis and z-axis on both sides. On the left, the direct target was located at y = 2 +/- 1.3 mm and z = 9.3 +/- 1.8 mm (both P = 0.02). On the right, the direct target was located at y = 2.9 +/- 1.8 mm and z = 9.2 +/- 2 mm (both P <= 0.0003). There was no significant difference in the x-coordinate on either side (P > 0.5). Additionally, there was a correlation between thalamic volume and difference between direct and indirect targets in the y-axis and the z-axis. Conclusion(s): We showed a significant difference in direct and indirect targeting in the y-axis and z-axis when targeting the ANT for deep brain stimulation for epilepsy. This difference is correlated to thalamic volume, with a larger difference noted in patients with thalamic atrophy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",15,,,
132,"Objective: Pharmaco-refractory focal motor epileptic seizures pose a significant challenge. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a recently recognized therapeutic option for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. To identify the specific target for focal motor seizures, we evaluate the modulatory effects of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation because of the critical role of STN in cortico-subcortical motor processing. Method(s): Seven patients with epilepsy with refractory seizures who underwent chronic stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) monitoring were studied in presurgical evaluation. Seizure onset zone was hypothesized to be partially involved in the motor areas in 6 patients. For each patient, one electrode was temporally implanted into the STN that was ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone. The cortical-subcortical seizure propagation was systemically evaluated. The simultaneously electrophysiological responses over distributed cortical areas to STN stimulation at varied frequencies were quantitatively assessed. Result(s): We observed the consistent downstream propagation of seizures from the motor cortex toward the ipsilateral STN and remarkable cortical responses on motor cortex to single-pulse STN stimulation. Furthermore, we showed frequency-dependent upstream modulatory effect of STN stimulation on motor cortex specifically. In contrast to the enhanced effects of low frequency stimulation, high-frequency stimulation of the STN can significantly reduce interictal spikes, high-frequency oscillations over motor cortex disclosing effective connections to the STN. Interpretation(s): This result showed that the STN is not only engaged in as a propagation network of focal motor seizures but STN stimulation can profoundly modulate the epileptic activity of motor cortex in humans, suggesting a mechanism-based alternative for patients suffering from refractory focal motor seizures.

133,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether and how vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces the epileptogenic activity in the bilateral cerebral cortex in patients with intractable epilepsy. We analyzed the electrocorticograms (ECoGs) of five patients who underwent callosotomy due to intractable epilepsy even after VNS implantation. We recorded ECoGs and analyzed power spectrum in both VNS OFF and ON phases. We counted the number of spikes and electrodes with epileptic spikes, distinguishing unilaterally and bilaterally hemispherically spread spikes as synchronousness of the epileptic spikes in both VNS OFF and ON phases. There were 24.80 +/- 35.55 and 7.20 +/- 9.93 unilaterally spread spikes in the VNS OFF and ON phases, respectively (P = 0.157), and 35.8 +/- 29.21 and 10.6 +/- 13.50 bilaterally spread spikes in the VNS OFF and ON phases, respectively (P = 0.027). The number of electrodes with unilaterally and bilaterally spread spikes in the VNS OFF and ON phases was 3.84 +/- 2.13 and 3.59 +/- 1.82 (P = 0.415), and 8.20 +/- 3.56 and 6.89 +/- 2.89 (P = 0.026), respectively. The ECoG background power spectra recordings in the VNS OFF and ON phases were also analyzed. The spectral power tended to be greater in the high-frequency band at VNS ON phase than OFF phase. This study showed the reduction of epileptogenic spikes and spread areas of the spikes by VNS as immediate effects, electrophysiologically.Copyright © 2020 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.",5,,,
134,"Aim: To evaluate cortical excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in children with new-onset epilepsy before and after antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Method(s): Fifty-five drug-naive patients (29 females, 26 males; 3-18y), with new-onset epilepsy were recruited from 1st May 2014 to 31st October 2017 at the Child Neurology Department, Queen Silvia's Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. We performed TMS in 48 children (23 females, 25 males; mean [SD] age 10y [3y], range 4-15y) with epilepsy (27 generalized and 21 focal) before and after the introduction of AEDs. We used single- and paired-pulse TMS. We used single-pulse TMS to record resting motor thresholds (RMTs), stimulus-response curves, and cortical silent periods (CSPs). We used paired-pulse TMS to record intracortical inhibition and facilitation at short, long, and intermediate intervals. Result(s): There were no differences in cortical excitability between children with generalized and focal epilepsy at baseline. After AED treatment, RMTs increased (p=0.001), especially in children receiving sodium valproate (p=0.005). CSPs decreased after sodium valproate was administered (p=0.050). As in previous studies, we noted a negative correlation between RMT and age in our study cohort. Paired-pulse TMS could not be performed in most children because high RMTs made suprathreshold stimulation impossible. Interpretation(s): Cortical excitability as measured with RMT decreased after the introduction of AEDs. This was seen in children with both generalized and focal epilepsy who were treated with sodium valproate, although it was most prominent in children with generalized epilepsy. We suggest that TMS might be used as a prognostic tool to predict AED efficacy. What this paper adds: Resting motor threshold (RMT) correlated negatively with age in children with epilepsy. No differences in cortical excitability were noted between patients with generalized and focal epilepsy. Treatment with antiepileptic drugs decreased cortical excitability as measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Decreased cortical excitability with increased RMT was recorded, especially after sodium valproate treatment.

135,"Background: Neuromodulation is recommended for patients with refractory tuberous sclerosis related epilepsy (TRE) who are unable to localize epileptogenic nodules after comprehensive preoperative evaluation or for patients and families who do not agree to resection. Case Description: We report a patient with refractory TRE who received deep brain stimulation of anterior thalamic nucleus (ANT-DBS) and achieved a satisfactory response. To our knowledge, this is the first case of TRE being treated with ANT-DBS. A 22-year-old male was admitted to the hospital for refractory TRE seeking surgical treatment. Seizures were mainly manifested by deep temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy and suspected to originate in the limbic system. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive potentially epileptogenic nodules in the brain lacking significant nodules. Scalp electroencephalogram showed a comprehensive, bilateral synchronous low-voltage rapid rhythm, unable to localize seizure origin. We performed bilateral ANT-DBS according to the preoperative evaluation, and the frequency and intensity of seizures were significantly reduced after the 15-month follow-up (P <0.05, Student's t-test). Our case extends the therapeutic indications of ANT-DBS to a certain extent, providing a neuromodulation alternative to vagus nerve stimulation for patients with TRE who are unsuitable candidates or refuse resection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",1,,,
136,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) is a recently approved therapy for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. To date, there is a poor understanding of the mechanism of action and lack of in vivo biomarkers. We propose a method for investigating the in vivo stimulation effects using blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and present the brain activation pattern associated with ANT DBS. Method(s): Two patients undergoing ANT DBS for epilepsy underwent BOLD MRI using a block design after the DBS was programmed to alternate ON/OFF in 30-second blocks. The scanner was triggered using surface electrophysiologic recordings to detect the DBS cycle. Nine total runs were obtained and were analyzed using a general linear model. Result(s): Active ANT stimulation produced activation within several areas of the brain, including the thalamus, bilateral anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, ventral tegmental area, hippocampus, striatum, and right angular gyrus. Conclusion(s): Using block-design BOLD MRI, we were able to show widespread activation resulting from ANT DBS. Overlap with multiple areas of both the default mode and limbic networks was shown, suggesting that these nodes may modulate the effect of seizure control with ANT DBS.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2,,,
137,"It remains an unsolved problem in the treatment of patients with refractory focal epilepsy originating from the motor cortex since resection surgery can result in significant morbidity. Neurostimulation has emerged as an effective method for treating patients who are not suitable for conventional surgical procedures due to its relative safety, reversibility, and lower risk of complications. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to be a potential target for treating refractory motor seizures. Here, we report a favorable outcome of unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN for a patient with drug-resistant focal myoclonic seizures during a 5-year follow-up period.Copyright © Translational lung cancer research.

138,"Background: Current implementations of direct brain stimulation for epilepsy in patients involve high-frequency (HFS) electrical current and targeting of grey matter. Studies have shown that low-frequency (LFS) fiber-tract stimulation may also prove effective. To compare the efficacy of high-frequency grey matter stimulation to the low-frequency fiber tract stimulation technique a well-controlled set of experiments using a single animal model of epilepsy is needed. Objective(s): The goal of this study was to determine the relative efficacy of different direct brain stimulation techniques for suppressing seizures using an acute rat model of focal cortical seizures. Method(s): 4-AP was injected into the S1 region of cortex in rodents over 3 h. LFPs were recorded from the seizure focus and mirror focus to monitor seizure frequency during the experiments. CC-LFS, HFS-ANT, Focal-HFS, or a transection of the CC was applied. Result(s): Stimulation of the CC yielded a 65% +/-14% (p = 0.0014) reduction of seizures in the focus and a 97% +/-15% (p = 0.0026) reduction in the mirror focus (n = 7). By comparison transection of the CC produced a 65% +/-18% reduction in the focus and a non-statistically significant reduction of 57% +/-18% (p = 0.1381) in the mirror focus (n = 5). All other methods of stimulation failed to have a statistically significant effect on seizure suppression. Conclusion(s): LFS of the CC is the only method of stimulation to significantly reduce seizure frequency in this model of focal cortical seizures. These results support the hypothesis that LFSof fiber tracts has significant potential for seizure control.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s)",0,,,
139,"Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) compared to vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and the continuation of antiepileptic drugs (AED) for the management of drug-refractory epilepsy characterized by partial onset seizures, in Colombia. Method(s): A Markov model was developed from a payer perspective, using a time horizon of 15 years. Health states included: seizure freedom, responders, non-responders, worsening on treatment, and worsening off treatment. Clinical data was collected from the SANTE Study, including baseline patient characteristics, effectiveness and adverse events. Effectiveness was defined by the number of seizures per month. Device longevity, procedures, resource and medication use were gathered and validated with a local Key Opinion Leader. Costs were taken from the official 2019 Colombian public price list; medical device prices were provided by Medtronic. Colombian mortality rates, and a 3.5% discount rate for health outcomes and costs, were assumed. Results were presented as cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). All costs were converted to 2019 US Dollars to allow for international comparison. Result(s): Total costs were estimated to be USD$57,410, USD$85,630 and USD$18,646 for DBS, VNS and AED, respectively. In terms of benefits, DBS resulted in 7.76 QALYs, VNS in 7.03 and 5.79 for AED. As such, DBS is a dominant therapy compared to VNS. In comparison to AED, DBS has an ICER of USD$19,757, resulting in a cost-effective therapy in Colombia considering a threshold of USD$19,953. The superior device longevity of DBS was the principal driver of the price difference between DBS and VNS. DBS has a longevity of 15 years. Conclusion(s): Our exploratory findings suggest that DBS is a cost-effective treatment strategy for patients with medically partial-onset seizures patients with refractory epilepsy in the Colombian healthcare system compared to AED and dominant in comparison to VNS.Copyright © 2020",0,,,
140,"Introduction: Stereo-EEG (sEEG) is a technique used to localize the seizure-onset zone for epilepsy surgery in people with drug-resistant focal seizures. Pathological crying reflects disordered emotional expression and the anterior insula is known to play a role in empathy and socio-emotional processing. We describe a patient where direct electrical stimulation of the anterior insula during sEEG generated pathological crying and profound sadness. Case Report/Case History: A 35-year-old left-handed female with drug resistant epilepsy had left temporal lobe surgery with retained mesial structures. Upon re-evaluation with video-EEG monitoring, interictal epileptiform discharges and multiple focal seizures localized to the left posterior temporal-parietal region. She subsequently underwent sEEG with 10 electrodes placed in the left hemisphere around prior surgical margins. Electrical stimulation was performed. Bipolar stimulation of deep electrodes (LV 1-2) in the anterior insular cortex at 5 mA, 50 Hz, 500 msec pulse width in trains of 4 seconds an initial "" emotional"" response and "" teary eyed"" signs were present and subjective symptoms of profound sadness. The task of continuous counting was interrupted, and she was unable to finish counting due to the intensity of emotion. Cognitive, motor, language function was normal with intact level of awareness. No post-operative "" lesion"" was present. When the stimulation was stopped, she returned to her normal mental state with recall of the emotion. This was reproducible with intensification upon repeat stimulation. Conclusion(s): Our case is unique in demonstrating transitory profound sadness and pathological crying during presurgical brain mapping for epilepsy. The timesynched temporal effect of stimulation provides strong causal pathophysiological relationship to implicate the anterior insula in the brain biology of pathological crying.",1,,,5.0
141,"The cortical silent period (CSP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been reported to be prolonged in 2 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) patients who pre-sented with periodic myoclonus. Herein, we will show a prominent prolongation of TMS-induced CSP in a patient with CJD who did not have periodic myoclonus. The patient was a 66-year-old woman who developed rapidly progressive dementia. No myoclonic jerks were observed. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed high-intensity lesions in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus on diffusion-weighted images. Electroen-cephalography (EEG) showed diffuse and continuous slow waves, but no periodic synchro-nous discharges (PSDs). A TMS study revealed that the duration of CSP was prominently prolonged: The duration of CSP (370 ms) equaled that of the mean + 6.5 SD of the normal value. One month after admission, the patient exhibited akinetic mutism and developed periodic myoclonus in her limbs. The clinical course was compatible with CJD. To date, CSP has been measured in only 2 CJD patients. The common findings in both cases were marked prolongation of CSP, periodic myoclonus, and PSD on EEG. In short, we demon-strated that TMS-induced CSP was prominently prolonged even at the early stage of CJD without periodic myoclonus or PSD. In other disorders, the CSP has not been reported to be comparably prolonged to that of CJD patients. Therefore, we conclude that TMS-in-duced CSP could be prominently prolonged even in the early stage of CJD. The marked prolongation of the CSP might be an early biomarker of CJD.

142,"Background: The Lance-Adams syndrome (LAS) is a myoclonus syndrome caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. LAS cases could be refractory to first-line medications, and the neuronal mechanism underlying LAS pathology remains unknown. Objective(s): To describe a patient with LAS who underwent bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) stimulation and discuss the pathophysiology of LAS with intraoperative electrophysiological findings. Patient(s): A 79-year-old woman presented with a history of cardiopulmonary arrest due to internal carotid artery rupture following carotid endarterectomy after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, within 1 month, the patient developed sensory stimulation-induced myoclonus in her face and extremities. Because her myoclonic symptoms were refractory to pharmacotherapy, deep brain stimulation of the GPi was performed 1 year after the hypoxic attack. Result(s): Continuous bilateral GPi stimulation with optimal parameter settings remarkably improved the patient's myoclonic symptoms. At the 2-year follow-up, her Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale score decreased from 90 to 24. In addition, we observed burst firing and interburst pause patterns on intraoperative microelectrode recordings of the bilateral GPi and stimulated this area as the therapeutic target. Conclusion(s): Our results show that impairment in the basal ganglion circuitry might be involved in the pathogenesis of myoclonus in patients with LAS.Copyright © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

143,"We report a case of a patient with drug-resistant epilepsy treated with deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS). The patient developed psychiatric side effects (PSEs), namely irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, and paranoia, after implantation and stimulation initiation. The stimulation was discontinued and the PSEs were mitigated, but the patient did not return to her pre-implantation state, as documented by repeated psychiatric reports and hospitalizations. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient who developed long-term PSEs that did not disappear after stimulation discontinuation. We suppose that ANT-DBS caused a persistent perturbation of the thalamic neuronal networks that are responsible for long-term PSEs.Copyright © 2019",1,,,
144,"Introduction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in drug-resistant epilepsy has been applied to several brain targets. However, its exact mechanism of action is not known, and the diversity of targets makes it difficult to know the degree of evidence that supports its use. Development. A review of the literature on DBS for drug-resistant epilepsy was conducted. The efficacy of DBS in drug-resistant epilepsy seems to be mediated by a desynchronisation of neuronal activity at the epileptogenic focus or a modulation of the 'circuitopathies' that exist in epilepsy, depending on the target. In DBS multiple cortical and subcortical structures have been used, but class I evidence exists only for DBS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Conclusions. DBS in epilepsy is still under investigation, with class I evidence for DBS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. The rest of the targets have yielded variable results that must be confirmed with randomised designs in larger series.Copyright © 2020 Revista de Neurologia",0,,,
145,"Despite the use of first-choice anti-epileptic drugs and satisfactory seizure outcome rates after resective epilepsy surgery, a considerable percentage of patients do not become seizure free. ANT-DBS may provide for an alternative treatment option in these patients. This literature review discusses the rationale, mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ANT-DBS in drug-resistant epilepsy patients. A review using systematic methods of the available literature was performed using relevant databases including Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library pertaining to the different aspects ANT-DBS. ANT-DBS for drug-resistant epilepsy is a safe, effective and well-tolerated therapy, where a special emphasis must be given to monitoring and neuropsychological assessment of both depression and memory function. Three patterns of seizure control by ANT-DBS are recognized, of which a delayed stimulation effect may account for an improved long-term response rate. ANT-DBS remotely modulates neuronal network excitability through overriding pathological electrical activity, decrease neuronal cell loss, through immune response inhibition or modulation of neuronal energy metabolism. ANT-DBS is an efficacious treatment modality, even when curative procedures or lesser invasive neuromodulative techniques failed. When compared to VNS, ANT-DBS shows slightly superior treatment response, which urges for direct comparative trials. Based on the available evidence ANT-DBS and VNS therapies are currently both superior compared to non-invasive neuromodulation techniques such as t-VNS and rTMS. Additional in-vivo research is necessary in order to gain more insight into the mechanism of action of ANT-DBS in localization-related epilepsy which will allow for treatment optimization. Randomized clinical studies in search of the optimal target in well-defined epilepsy patient populations, will ultimately allow for optimal patient stratification when applying DBS for drug-resistant patients with epilepsy.Copyright © 2018, The Author(s).",0,,,
146,"Neuromodulation therapies represent an important treatment arm for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) who are not candidates for resective surgery. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) - the neurostimulation modality in focus in this review - was the first available neuromodulatory therapy for DRE and was followed by anterior thalamic deep brain stimulation (ANT-DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS). Although no comparative trials of these treatments have been performed, published data and clinical experience suggest comparable effectiveness. In VNS, DBS and RNS seizure reduction is delayed and increases over time raising the question of anti-epileptogenic mechanisms of neuromodulation. Considering the long-term effectiveness assumed for neuromodulatory treatments and the chronic nature of drug-resistant epilepsy, study designs allowing for long-term comparative observations would be of great value, but are hindered by the inherent nature of a long-term [surgical] control group and the bias associated with open-label trials. New trial designs using objective endpoints are needed, and may be aided by novel biomarkers of risk and disease severity for specific epilepsy populations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",0,,,
147,"Background: Epilepsy and migraine are paroxysmal neurological conditions associated with disturbances of cortical excitability. No useful biomarkers to monitor disease activity in these conditions are available. Phase clustering was previously described in electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to photic stimulation and may be a potential epilepsy biomarker. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to investigate EEG phase clustering in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), compare it with photic stimulation in controls, and explore its potential as a biomarker of genetic generalized epilepsy or migraine with aura. Method(s): People with (possible) juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), migraine with aura, and healthy controls underwent single-pulse TMS with concomitant EEG recording during the interictal period. We compared phase clustering after TMS with photic stimulation across the groups using permutation-based testing. Result(s): We included eight people with (possible) JME (five off medication, three on), 10 with migraine with aura, and 37 controls. The TMS and photic phase clustering spectra showed significant differences between those with epilepsy without medication and controls. Two phase clustering-based indices successfully captured these differences between groups. One participant was tested multiple times. In this case, the phase clustering-based indices were inversely correlated with the dose of antiepileptic medication. Phase clustering did not differ between people with migraine and controls. Conclusion(s): We present methods to quantify phase clustering using TMS-EEG and show its potential value as a measure of brain network activity in genetic generalized epilepsy. Our results suggest that the higher propensity to phase clustering is not shared between genetic generalized epilepsy and migraine.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",0,,,
148,"Objective To describe an adult patient with Rasmussen's disease with focal dystonia as the most disabling symptom and the good response to unilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS). Methods Retrospective review of clinical records and diagnostic tests. Results The patient had displayedmild focal seizures with sensory and motor symptoms on the left arm and hemiface since the age of 22. Ten years later she experienced abrupt onset of focal left dystonia involving mainly the leg. Brain MRI showed progressive right hemisphere atrophy, and 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18 FDG-PET) showed right hypometabolism mainly over the frontal and insular regions. Brain biopsy confirmed chronic encephalitis. The dystonia became very severe and made walking extremely difficult. Different treatments including dopaminergic, anticholinergic, immunomodulatory drugs and botulinum toxin were ineffective. Finally the patient was treated with unilateral GPi DBS. Shortly after the onset of the stimulation, the dystonia started to improve. Parameters have been adjusted, and 18 months after surgery the patient is able to walk and run unaided, although a mild left leg dystonia persists. Conclusion Rasmussen's disease may be difficult to diagnose in adult patients. Associated movement disorders may be more disabling than seizures. Focal dystonia may be treated successfully with DBS.Copyright © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.",1,,,
149,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has provided new treatment options for refractory epilepsy; however, treatment outcomes of DBS in refractory epilepsy patients previously treated with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have not been clarified. Herein, treatment outcomes of DBS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS) in patients who had previously experienced VNS failure are reported. Seven patients who had previously experienced VNS failure underwent ANT-DBS device implantation. VNS was turned off before DBS device implantation. Monthly seizure counts starting from baseline to 12-18 months after DBS were analyzed. Five (71.3%) of the 7 patients experienced a >50% reduction of seizure counts after DBS; 1 responder reached a seizure-free status after DBS therapy. Of the 2 nonresponders, 1 subject showed improvement in seizure strength and duration, which lessened the impact of the seizures on the patient's quality of life. This is the first study in which favorable outcomes of ANT-DBS surgery were observed in individual patients with refractory epilepsy who had not responded to prior VNS. Further studies with a larger number of subjects and longer follow-up period are needed to confirm the feasibility of ANT-DBS in patients who have previously experienced VNS failure.© 2019 S.

151,"Closed-loop brain stimulation is one of the few treatments available for patients who are ineligible for traditional surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone, due to having generalized epilepsy, multifocal epilepsy, or focal epilepsy localized to an eloquent brain region. Due to its clinical efficacy and potential to delivery personalized therapy based on an individual's own intracerebral electrophysiology, this treatment is becoming an important part of clinical practice, despite a limited understanding of how to program detection and stimulation parameters for optimal, patient-specific benefit. To bring this challenge into focus, we review the evolution of neural stimulation for epilepsy, provide a technical overview of the RNS System (the only FDA-approved closed-loop device), and discuss the major challenges of working with a closed-loop device. We then propose an evidence-based solution for individualizing therapy that is driven by a bottom-up informatics approach.Copyright © 2018, The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.",0,,,
152,"Association of Cortical Stimulation-Induced Seziure With Surgical Outcome in Patients With Focal Drug-Resistant Epilepsy Cuello Oderiz C, von Ellenrieder N, Dubeau F, et al. JAMA Neurol. 2019. Importance: Cortical stimulation is used during presurgical epilepsy evaluation for functional mapping and for defining the cortical area responsible for seizure generation. Despite wide use of cortical stimulation, the association between cortical stimulation-induced seizures and surgical outcome remains unknown. Objective(s): To assess whether the removal of the seizure-onset zone resulting from cortical stimulation is associated with a good surgical outcome. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study used data from 2 tertiary epilepsy centers: Montreal Neurological Institute in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Grenoble Alpes University Hospital in Grenoble, France. Participants included consecutive patients (n = 103) with focal drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent stereoelectroencephalography between January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017. Participant selection criteria were cortical stimulation during implantation, subsequent open surgical procedure with a follow-up of 1 or more years, and complete neuroimaging data sets for superimposition between intracranial electrodes and the resection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cortical stimulation-induced typical electroclinical seizures, the volume of the surgical resection, and the percentage of resected electrode contacts inducing a seizure or encompassing the cortical stimulation-informed and spontaneous seizure-onset zones were identified. These measures were correlated with good (Engel class I) and poor (Engel classes II-IV) surgical outcomes. Electroclinical characteristics associated with cortical stimulation-induced seizures were analyzed. Result(s): In total, 103 patients were included, of whom 54 (52.4%) were female, and the mean (standard deviation) age was 31 (11) years. Fifty-nine (57.3%) patients had cortical stimulation-induced seizures. The percentage of patients with cortical stimulation-induced electroclinical seizures was higher in the good outcome group than in the poor outcome group (31 [70.5%] of 44 vs 28 [47.5%] of 59; P =.02). The percentage of the resected contacts encompassing the cortical stimulation-informed seizure-onset zone correlated with surgical outcome (median [range] percentage in good vs poor outcome: 63.2% [0%-100%] vs 33.3% [0%-84.6%]; Spearman rho = 0.38; P =.003). A similar result was observed for spontaneous seizures (median [range] percentage in good vs poor outcome: 57.1% [0%-100%] vs 32.7% [0%-100%]; Spearman rho = 0.32; P =.002). Longer elapsed time since the most recent seizure was associated with a higher likelihood of inducing seizures (>24 hours: 64.7% vs <24 hours: 27.3%; P =.04). Conclusions and Relevance: Seizure induction by cortical stimulation appears to identify the epileptic generator as reliably as spontaneous seizures do; this finding might lead to a more time-efficient intracranial presurgical investigation of focal epilepsy as the need to record spontaneous seizures is reduced.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",103,,,
153,"Background: Whereas transient, self-limiting seizures are an infrequent but known complication of deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation surgery, stimulation itself has occasionally been reported to result in seizure activity at delayed time points. The neural circuitry implicated in stimulation-induced seizures is unknown. Case Description: A 47-year-old woman underwent chronic subcallosal cingulate DBS for treatment of refractory anorexia nervosa and experienced seizure with stimulation onset. Supratherapeutic voltage caused a generalized seizure. The patient subsequently experienced a full recovery. We reviewed the literature for other cases of delayed postoperative DBS seizures associated with stimulation. We also investigated whether the higher voltage may have recruited networks implicated in epilepsy. The supratherapeutic voltage stimulated a larger area and engaged vulnerable networks, including bilateral hippocampi, cingulate gyrus, and temporal lobes. Literature review identified 20 studies reporting delayed seizure after DBS surgery, 13 of which demonstrated a robust association with mostly nonmotor DBS stimulation. Conclusion(s): Nonmotor DBS targets, particularly in patients with epilepsy, may be more vulnerable to stimulation-induced seizures; as such, extra caution should be used when programming stimulation parameters at these DBS targets.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",1,,,
154,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) requires precise localization, which is especially difficult at the thalamus, and even more difficult in anesthetized patients. We aimed to characterize the neurophysiological properties of the ventral intermediate (V.im), ventral caudal (V.c), and centromedian parvo (Ce.pc) and the magnocellular (Ce.mc) thalamic nuclei. We obtained microelectrode recordings from five patients with refractory epilepsy under general anesthesia. Somatosensory evoked potentials recorded by microelectrodes were used to identify the V.c nucleus. Trajectories were reconstructed off-line to identify the nucleus recorded, and the amplitude of the action potential (AP) and the tonic (i.e., mean frequency, density, probability of interspike interval) and phasic (i.e., burst index, pause index, and pause ratio) properties of the pattern discharges were analyzed. The Mahalanobis metric was used to evaluate the similarity of the patterns. The mean AP amplitude was higher for the V.im nucleus (172.7 +/- 7.6 microV) than for the other nuclei, and the mean frequency was lower for the Ce.pc nucleus (7.2 +/- 0.8 Hz) and higher for the V.c nucleus (11.9 +/- 0.8 Hz) than for the other nuclei. The phasic properties showed a bursting pattern for the V.c nucleus and a tonic pattern for the centromedian and V.im nuclei. The Mahalanobis distance was the shortest for the V.im/V.c and Ce.mp/Ce.pc pairs. Therefore, the different properties of the thalamic nuclei, even for patients under general anesthesia, can be used to positively define the recorded structure, improving the exactness of electrode placement in DBS.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

156,"We report the first patient to die from refractory convulsive status epilepticus (SE) after the removal of a stimulator. The removal occurred after a two-year period of successful control of super-refractory convulsive SE with deep brain stimulation of the bilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS). The female patient, born in 1990, suffered from high fever and seizures, and was diagnosed with viral encephalitis in 2005. After four weeks of medical treatment, she recovered with no neurological disabilities, but suffered from monthly seizures. Ten years later, the patient presented with convulsive SE, while four months pregnant in February of 2015. Her SE remained super-refractory to drugs despite the termination of pregnancy. Therefore, ANT-DBS was performed in March of 2015. The patient became SE-free following activation of an ANT-DBS stimulator. However, the stimulation treatment was terminated according to the family's request when a tremor developed two years after the treatment had begun. Subsequently, four SE episodes occurred and the tremor did not improve. The stimulator and electrodes were removed in August of 2017. The patient died of an uncontrolled SE two months later. This case demonstrates the effectiveness of ANT-DBS for emergency super-refractory convulsive SE with both positive and negative outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Epileptic Disorders",1,,,
157,"OBJECTIVE Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) presents a therapeutic challenge in children, necessitating the consideration of multiple treatment options. Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been studied in adults with DRE, little evidence is available to guide clinicians regarding the application of this potentially valuable tool in children. Here, the authors present the first systematic review aimed at understanding the safety and efficacy of DBS for DRE in pediatric populations, emphasizing patient selection, device placement and programming, and seizure outcomes. METHODS The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and recommendations. Relevant articles were identified from 3 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL) from their inception to November 17, 2017. Inclusion criteria of individual studies were 1) diagnosis of DRE; 2) treatment with DBS; 3) inclusion of at least 1 pediatric patient (age <= 18 years); and 4) patient-specific data. Exclusion criteria for the systematic review included 1) missing data for age, DBS target, or seizure freedom; 2) nonhuman subjects; and 3) editorials, abstracts, review articles, and dissertations. RESULTS This review identified 21 studies and 40 unique pediatric patients (ages 4-18 years) who received DBS treatment for epilepsy. There were 18 patients with electrodes placed in the bilateral or unilateral centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CM) electrodes, 8 patients with bilateral anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) electrodes, 5 patients with bilateral and unilateral hippocampal electrodes, 3 patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) and 1 patient with unilateral STN electrodes, 2 patients with bilateral posteromedial hypothalamus electrodes, 2 patients with unilateral mammillothalamic tract electrodes, and 1 patient with caudal zona incerta electrode placement. Overall, 5 of the 40 (12.5%) patients had an International League Against Epilepsy class I (i.e., seizure-free) outcome, and 34 of the 40 (85%) patients had seizure reduction with DBS stimulation. CONCLUSIONS DBS is an alternative or adjuvant treatment for children with DRE. Prospective registries and future clinical trials are needed to identify the optimal DBS target, although favorable outcomes are reported with both CM and ATN in children.Copyright © AANS 2019.",18,,,
158,"Objective: The effect of continuous subthreshold cortical stimulation (CSCS) over the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in epilepsy was analyzed to delineate the affected physiological processes. Method(s): ECoG data was recorded over SOZ and adjacent regions in patients (n = 7) with refractory-epilepsy. Data was reviewed before and during 2 Hz cortical electrical stimulation. Group differences were estimated using ANOVA and correlation with Pearson's r. Result(s): CSCS reduced background ECoG power at SOZ (p < 0.05), increased spectral coherence (p < 0.05) and reduced spike rate (p < 0.01) over all recorded sites. Spectral power and coherence (p < 0.01) correlated with spike rate at SOZ but not with each other at any location. Spike morphology correlated with spike-rate over all recorded sites (p < 0.0001) and with spectral power and coherence at SOZ (p < 0.01). Conclusion(s): This study shows changes in cortical electrophysiology during CSCS over the SOZ where spike rate reduction correlated with two independent electrophysiological parameters, background power and coherence. These results suggest the possibility of a causal relationship between spectral power, coherence and interictal spikes which may be related to seizure rate. Significance: Improved understanding of the effect of electrical stimulation on epileptic tissue could suggest improvements in stimulation paradigms to reduce seizure frequency.Copyright © 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology",0,,,
159,"We report the case of a patient suffering from pharmacotherapy-resistant bilateral progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) showing a beneficial response upon selective deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the substantia nigra pars reticulata. As an individual experimental therapeutic approach, we implanted DBS electrodes in the transitional zone between the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Electrode placement allowed for a selective stimulation of either the STN, SNr, or both targets. Postoperatively, we observed a moderate subjective and objective improvement in positive and negative myoclonus by high-frequency DBS of the STN/SNr transitional zone. However, a systematic exploration of different stimulation settings revealed that monopolar stimulation of the substantia nigra alone was more effective than high-frequency monopolar DBS of either the motor STN (monopolar) or stimulation of both targets (STN/SNr). This observation confirms earlier findings showing that patients with PME benefit from high-frequency DBS. However, in contrast to previous reports stimulating the STN/SNr transitional zone, our patient showed the most significant effect upon selective stimulation of the SNr. We propose that in patients undergoing DBS for myoclonus, at least one electrode contact should be placed in the SNr allowing for selective monopolar stimulation of this target.Copyright © 2019 Epileptic Disorders",0,,,
160,"Deep brain disease stimulation (DBS) is commonly used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson disease, and current evidence suggests that DBS may also be useful for refractory epilepsy and is affected by a variety of factors. Studies show that stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and hippocampus may decrease the frequency of refractory seizures. The efficacy of stimulating other targets remains inconclusive. An absence of structural abnormality on imaging and electrode position are associated with stimulation efficacy. Certain seizure types may respond more favorably to specific targets. There are several factors that potentially predict seizure outcome following DBS, but more large-scale clinical trials are needed.Copyright © 2019 by the Chinese Medical Association.",0,,,
161,"Introduction: Deep brain stimulation is a safe and effective neurointerventional technique for the treatment of movement disorders. Electrical stimulation of subcortical structures may exert a control on seizure generators initiating epileptic activities. The aim of this review is to present the targets of the deep brain stimulation for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Method(s): We performed a structured review of the literature from 1980 to 2018 using Medline and PubMed. Articles assessing the impact of deep brain stimulation on seizure frequency in patients with DRE were selected. Meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies were included. Result(s): To date, deep brain stimulation of various neural targets has been investigated in animal experiments and humans. This article presents the use of stimulation of the anterior and centromedian nucleus of the thalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, cerebellum and hypothalamus. Anterior thalamic stimulation has demonstrated efficacy and there is evidence to recommend it as the target of choice. Conclusion(s): Deep brain stimulation for seizures may be an option in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation could be recommended over other targets.Copyright © 2019 Zangiabadi, Ladino, Sina, Orozco-Hernandez, Carter and Tellez-Zenteno.",0,,,
162,"Importance: A bidirectional brain-computer interface that performs neurostimulation has been shown to improve seizure control in patients with refractory epilepsy, but the therapeutic mechanism is unknown. Objective(s): To investigate whether electrographic effects of responsive neurostimulation (RNS), identified in electrocorticographic (ECOG) recordings from the device, are associated with patient outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Retrospective review of ECOG recordings and accompanying clinical meta-data from 11 consecutive patients with focal epilepsy who were implanted with a neurostimulation system between January 28, 2015, and June 6, 2017, with 22 to 112 weeks of follow-up. Recorded ECOG data were obtained from the manufacturer; additional system-generated meta-data, including recording and detection settings, were collected directly from the manufacturer's management system using an in-house, custom-built platform. Electrographic seizure patterns were identified in RNS recordings and evaluated in the time-frequency domain, which was locked to the onset of the seizure pattern. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patterns of electrophysiological modulation were identified and then classified according to their latency of onset in relation to triggered stimulation events. Seizure control after RNS implantation was assessed by 3 main variables: mean frequency of seizure occurrence, estimated mean severity of seizures, and mean duration of seizures. Overall seizure outcomes were evaluated by the extended Personal Impact of Epilepsy Scale questionnaires, a patient-reported outcome measure of 3 domains (seizure characteristics, medication adverse effects, and quality of life), with a range of possible scores from 0 to 300 in which lower scores indicate worse status, and the Engel scale, which comprises 4 classes (I-IV) in which lower numbers indicate greater improvement. Result(s): Electrocorticographic data from 11 patients (8 female; mean [range] age, 35 [19-65] years; mean [range] duration of epilepsy, 19 [5-37] years) were analyzed. Two main categories of electrophysiological signatures of stimulation-induced modulation of the seizure network were discovered: direct and indirect effects. Direct effects included ictal inhibition and early frequency modulation but were not associated with improved clinical outcomes (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.06-7.35; P >.99). Only indirect effects - those occurring remote from triggered stimulation - were associated with improved clinical outcomes (OR, infinity; 95% CI, -infinity to infinity; P =.02). These indirect effects included spontaneous ictal inhibition, frequency modulation, fragmentation, and ictal duration modulation. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that RNS effectiveness may be explained by long-term, stimulation-induced modulation of seizure network activity rather than by direct effects on each detected seizure..Copyright © 2019 American Medical Association.

163,"Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted premarket approval for bilateral anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation as adjunctive treatment for reducing the frequency of partial-onset seizures in adults who are refractory to three or more antiepileptic medications. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) is a primary component of the limbic system (the Papez circuit), which represents a fundamental pathway for seizure propagation. Scholars speculated that ANT is an anatomic target that may halt or influence seizure propagation or epileptogenic foci originating within the limbic system. Some suggestions on the possible factors associated with the efficacy of ANT stimulation put forward by experts are helpful. However, given the limited clinical data, there is a lack of valid predictors of individual treatment response. Most importantly, rational patient selection relies on a detailed and careful anatomo-electro-clinical analysis for individualized treatment.Copyright © 2019 by the Chinese Medical Association.",0,,,
164,"BACKGROUND: The Medtronic Registry for Epilepsy (MORE; Medtronic Inc, Dublin, Ireland) is an open label observational study evaluating the long-term effectiveness, safety, and performance of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of thalamus (ANT) for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. OBJECTIVE(S): To compare the difference in success rate of placing contacts at ANT-target region (ANT-TR) between transventricular (TV) and extraventricular (EV) lead trajectories in 73 ANT-DBS implants in 17 European centers participating in the MORE registry. METHOD(S): The success rate of placing contacts at ANT-TR was evaluated using a screening method combining both individual patient imaging information and stereotactic atlas information to identify contacts at ANT-TR. RESULT(S): EV lead trajectory was used in 53% of the trajectories. Approximately, 90% of the TV lead trajectories had at least 1 contact at ANT-TR, vs only 71% of the EV lead trajectories. The success rate for placing at least 1 contact at ANT-TR bilaterally was 84% for TV implants and 58% for EV implants (P < .05; Fisher's exact). No intracranial bleedings were observed, but 1 cortical infarct was reported following EV lead trajectory. CONCLUSION(S): The results of this registry support the use of TV lead trajectories for ANT-DBS as they have a higher probability in placing contacts at ANT-TR, without appearing to compromise procedural safety. Follow-up data collection is continuing in the MORE registry. These data will provide outcomes associated with TV and EV trajectories.Copyright © 2018 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",0,,,
165,"Objective: To assess the ability of functional MRI (fMRI) to predict postoperative language decline compared to direct cortical stimulation (DCS) in epilepsy surgery patients. Method(s): In this prospective case series, 17 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy had intracranial monitoring and resection from 2012 to 2016 with 1-year follow-up. All patients completed preoperative language fMRI, mapping with DCS of subdural electrodes, pre- and postoperative neuropsychological testing for language function, and resection. Changes in language function before and after surgery were assessed. fMRI activation and DCS electrodes in the resection were evaluated as potential predictors of language decline. Result(s): Four of 17 patients (12 female; median [range] age, 43 [23-59] years) experienced postoperative language decline 1 year after surgery. Two of 4 patients had overlap of fMRI activation, language-positive electrodes in basal temporal regions (within 1 cm), and resection. Two had overlap between resection volume and fMRI activation, but not DCS. fMRI demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 46% specificity for outcome compared to DCS (50% and 85%, respectively). When fMRI and DCS language findings were concordant, the combined tests showed 100% sensitivity and 75% specificity for language outcome. Seizure-onset age, resection side, type, volume, or 1 year seizure outcome did not predict language decline. Significance: Language localization overlap of fMRI and direct cortical stimulation in the resection influences postoperative language performance. Our preliminary study suggests that fMRI may be more sensitive and less specific than direct cortical stimulation. Together they may predict outcome better than either test alone.Copyright Published 2019. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.",17,,,
166,"Objectives: The safety and effect on seizure frequency of anterior thalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation were studied in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. Patients were followed for 12 months. The first 6 months were blinded with regard to active stimulation or not. After 6 months, all patients received active stimulation. Material(s) and Method(s): Bilateral ANT electrodes were implanted into 18 patients suffering from focal, pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Antiepileptic treatment was kept unchanged from three months prior to operation. The Liverpool seizure severity scale (LSSS) was used to measure the burden of epilepsy. Result(s): There was no significant difference between the 2 groups at the end of the blinded period at 6 months. However, when considering all patients and comparing 6 months of stimulation with baseline, there was a significant, 22% reduction in the frequency of all seizures (P = 0.009). Four patients had >=50% reduction in total seizure frequency and 5 patients >=50% reduction in focal seizures after 6 months of stimulation. No increased effect over time was shown. LSSS at 6 months compared to baseline showed no significant difference between the 2 groups, but a small, significant reduction in LSSS was found when all patients had received stimulation for 6 months. Conclusion(s): Our study supports results from earlier studies concerning DBS as a safe treatment option, with effects even in patients with severe, refractory epilepsy. However, our results are not as encouraging as those reported from many other, mainly unblinded, and open studies.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",18,,,

168,"Introduction: Since the study is a postulation, the abstract cannot be structured as per recommended format; hence, the abstract is submitted as one paragraph below. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) has established as an effective adjunctive therapy for patients with intractable epilepsy (IE) not suitable for epilepsy brain surgery and/or vagal nerve stimulation. The judicious selection of DBS parameters (DBSPs) plays a crucial role in the success of ATN-DBS. Conventionally, DBSPs are selected by trial and error requiring multiple sessions and hospital visits warranting a strong need for optimization of the DBSPs with objective assessment of its effects. The author presents an EEG-guided novel and superior approach to the selection of effective DBSPs targeted to induce EEGdesynchronization, which is known to exert potent antiepileptic influence with possibly possession of an additional anti-kindling effect that can suppress or even arrest the ongoing process of epileptogenesis in the patients with intractable epilepsy in addition to exercising control over the intractable seizures. It is further claimed that the innovative EEGguided approach can successfully optimize the DBSPs resulting in (a) minimum sessions of DBSP adjustments, thereby reducing the frequency of hospital visits (b) minimum side effects and (c) minimum consumption of the device battery; thus, prolonging its life. Preliminary results of the clinical application of the novel approach in the selection of the DBSPs in a small case series have been very promising and encouraging despite which it is strongly recommended that well designed large sized studies are required for its validation and successful clinical outcome.

169,"Introduction: Neuromodulation is an alternative treatment for patients who aren't resective epilepsy surgery remediable. Deep brain stimulation(DBS) was approved by FDA lately for adult patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). The experience of DBS for children with DRE is limited. In this study, we would like to report two children who had callosotomy and subsequent DBS treatment for more than 4 years. Case report: The first case is a 19-year-old female patient who has seizure onset at the age of 11 after meningoencephalitis. Her seizures were characterized by focal motor seizures with impaired of awareness followed by bilateral tonicclonic seizures. The seizure occurred 3 to 5 times per day and was refractory to medication. The EEG suggested diffuse cortical dysfunction with multifocal epileptogenecity. She received callosotomy when she was 13 years old with limited responses. DBS at bilateral anterior thalami was performed at age of 14. Now she had only brief nocturnal seizures 2 to 5 times per months and reduction of baseline AED dosage. The second case is a 16-year-old male patient, who has seizure onset at 3 years old and intellectual disability. He had daily disabling seizures in spite of 7 different AEDs. Video-EEG showed multiple types of seizures compatible with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Limited response was recorded after receiving callosotomy when he was 12 years old. He then underwent DBS in bilateral anterior thalami half year after the callosotomy. Now he takes three AEDs for seizure control and has 4-6 brief seizures per month. Improvement of cognition was also noted. Conclusion(s): Deep brain stimulation in bilateral anterior thalami could play an ideal treatment in children with drug resistant epilepsy with a previous callosotomy. The long term seizure outcomes are satisfactory in our cases. Prospective registries and future clinical trials are needed to identify the suitable candidates for DBS.",0,,,
170,"Purpose: We used a self-developed multiple channel neural stimulator programed by a smart phone to deliver continuous low-frequency electrical stimulation to bilateral endopiriform nuclei (EPN) to investigate whether EPN-DBS can significantly control chronic epilepsy in rats. Method(s): A piece of cobalt wire was implanted into left motor cortex in SD rats to induce chronic epilepsy. Two screw electrodes and two tungsten depth electrodes were implanted into bilateral motor cortex and hippocampus CA1. Two bipolar tungsten stimulation electrodes were stereotactically implanted into bilateral EPN by stimulating each side of EPN separately and recording the evoked potential (EP) in ipsilateral CA1. Three days after surgery, all the rats were subjected to long term video-EEG monitoring and behavioral seizures were assessed by Racine scale. Simultaneously, bilateral EPN nuclei were stimulated with 1 Hz sustained stimulus until three consecutive days without seizures. Result(s): Results show that average number of seizures per day in EPN-DBS group was significantly reduced (3.2 +/- 0.2/d, n = 5) compared with control group (8.1 +/- 1.0/d, n = 5, p < 0.001) and sham stimulation group (7.6 +/- 0.8/d, n = 5, p < 0.001). Seizure behavioral score (Racine scale) in EPN-DBS group was significantly lower (3.0 +/- 0.2/d, n = 5) than control group (4.1 +/- 0.1/d, n = 5, p < 0.001) and sham stimulation group (4.0 +/- 0.2/d, n = 5, p < 0.001). Electroencephalogram spectral analysis showed that the power of theta band of seizures in EPN stimulation group was significantly reduced compared to the control group and sham stimulation group (p < 0. 01). Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrate that sustained 1 Hz low frequency stimulation of bilateral EPN can reduce the number of seizures and the seizure behavioral score in chronic focal epilepsy in rats, which suggests that EPN may be a potential target for clinical DBS for drug refractory epilepsy. In addition, the inhibition of electroencephalogram broadband spectrum power, especially power of theta band, may be the underlying mechanismto control seizures.",0,,,
171,"To evaluate motor cortex excitability as a function of lateralization relative to the seizure focus in child with intractable epilepsy undergoing navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) for presurgical mapping. nTMS is a method for focal noninvasive cortical stimulation where small intracranial electrical currents are generated by a powerful extracranial fluctuating magnetic field. Resting motor threshold (rMT), motor evoked potentials (MEPs), silent period (SP) serves as a measure of motor cortex excitability was assessed in both hands in 10 year old right-handed girl k/c of epilepsy and left side hemiparesis. There was significant difference in rMT, MEPs and SP between the hemispheres. The response of MEPs was more towards unaffected hemisphere. nTMS is a safe and tolerable procedure in children with intractable epilepsy. These results highlighted the potential for inducing lasting modulation of excitability in M1 by navigated TMS of the healthy M1, possibly reflecting modulation of interactions and demonstrating the potential use of such a paradigm.Copyright © 2019",0,,,
172,"Background and aims: TMS is promising for additional therapy pharmacoresistant epilepsy, but there is no methodology of its application. Method(s): The study included 35 patients with drugresistant focal seizures who received 20 sessions of TMS with the positive clinical dynamic. TMS was done in the sitting position to occipital zone of the head fixedly. Exposition was 10 seconds, pulse induction of 2.0 T and a frequency 5 Hz by biphasic pulse generation. The interval between the series was 20 seconds, the number of series-20, total duration - 10 minutes. Stimulation was carried out daily for 20 days with a break of 5 days after the first 10. Result(s): 24 of them, 6 months after the course of TMS had increasing seizures more 25% or aggravation seizures. They conducted an additional course of TMS, and were observed in 3, 6 and 12 months after the additional course. After 3 months after the repeated course of TMS, there was a decrease in the frequency of seizures, more than after the basic TMS. (decrease by 100% in 80% of patients (p<0.01), 75-99% in 8.5% of patients, 50-74% in 2.8%, less than 49% - in 8.5%). Six months after the additional course of TMS, there was a significant decrease in the effect. Conclusion(s): Repeated courses of TMS are appropriate for additional treatment of patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. There was improvement in the effect compared with a single course of TMS, but the effect remains unstable, which makes it necessary to further study the optimization of TMS in epilepsy.",35,,,
173,"Objectives: The submission is a postulation; hence, has not been structured as per required format. Method(s): The pathogenesis and management of intractable epilepsy (IE) remain a challenge to neuroscientists even today. Electrical stimulation techniques like vagal nerve and deep brain stimulations have assumed significant role as adjunctive therapies. The author postulates pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as a novel target for electrical stimulation as an adjunctive therapy in IE, essentially based on the strong antiepileptic property of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep controlled by acetylcholine neurons (AChN) in the PPN, the stimulation of which is found to induce and enhance REM sleep. Even the severe EEG abnormalities (hypsarrhythmia) in West syndrome (WS) disappear during REM sleep; furthermore, in autopsy examination of cases of WS, the number of AChN in PPN in particular have been found to be reduced with relative preservation of other neurons, suggesting a specific involvement of AChN in epileptogenesis. Adrenocorticotrphic hormone is believed to decrease intractable spasms in WS not only through hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal axis but also through a direct action on the pontine tegmentum probably via REM sleep and the anticonvulsant, lamotrigine, is also found to block alpha4beta2nAChRs-mediated currents. Therefore, PPN stimulation is postulated for inducing and enhancing the genesis of REM sleep throughout the night sleep time that is normally composed mainly of non-rapid eye movement fraction during which the susceptibility to seizure generation and occurrence is known to be enhanced. Involvement and functioning of the PPN in locomotion have already formed the basis of its stimulation in controlling gait impairment in Parkinson's disease.

174,"Objectives: Focal onset epilepsy impairs patient quality of life via seizures and medication side effects. Patients often become refractory to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) with significant side effects that reduce frequency, but rarely eliminate seizures. Thus, improvement in quality of life (treatment utility) can stem from a reduction of seizure frequency and/or side effects. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) directed at the seizure onset zone has emerged as an adjunctive treatment to reduce seizure frequency. We employ a meta-analytic strategy to determine relative efficacy, safety, and utility of AEDs versus adjunctive TMS for treatment of focal refractory epilepsy. Method(s): A PubMed search was performed for studies of refractory focal onset epilepsy patients initiating a new AED or adjunctive TMS. Inclusion criteria were: studies of more than one patient, patients above 16 years of age, refractory to at least one AED, and reported baseline and post-treatment seizure frequency. Efficacy and side effect data from AED (n = 29) and TMS (n = 7) studies meeting criteria were pooled. Published utility values for seizure reduction and side effects drove a decision-analysis model comparing treatment utilities. Result(s): A total of 6975 patients were included in the analysis, representing 5487 AEDs, 193 TMS, and 1295 placebo patients. TMS patients had higher baseline seizure frequency and shorter trial duration. With regards to seizure frequency; AEDs, TMS, and placebo demonstrated 48.4% (SD 20.4), 34.4% (SD 39.9), and 26.3% (SD 11.4) reduction, respectively. On average, AED patients experienced 2.1 side effect events, TMS 0.12, and placebo 1.0 during the treatment period. The overall utility improvement was 32.4 % (SD 1.3), 33.0 % (SD 0.6), and 26.3% (0.1 SD), respectively, amongst the groups (F = 1936, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): For refractory focal epilepsy patients, anti-epileptic drugs maintain a non-significant advantage in reducing seizure frequency over adjunctive TMS. However, given significant side effects associated with AEDs, our model predicts adjunctive TMS imparts superior improvement in quality of life (overall utility). This is mediated through a moderate reduction of seizure frequency, but driven by less frequent side effects. Clinicians may accept a lower seizure reduction for side-effect sparing therapies in the refractory epilepsy patient population.",1295,,,
175,"Objectives: The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) is well recognized after successful results of SANTE trial and followed reports. Thus recently it is approved by United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). However optimal site for stimulation in the 'ATN' is not clear with various hypothesis. Method(s): We reviewed the location of active contacts in 19 patients (38 electrode) of ATN DBS implanted in single center. Fused image of pre-operative magnetic resonance image and post-operative computed tomography image were used to identify the contact location. The location was measured by stereotactic reference and relative index which is relative location within ATN, anterior border as 0 posterior border as 1, was also measured. Futhermore, anteriority based on location of mamillothalamic tract (mtt), and the distance between active contact and the mtt were measured. Average seizure frequency over 3 months was collected and more than 50% of seizure frequency reduction at final follow up period was considered as effective treatment. Result(s): Mean seizure reduction rate was 62.3% (range, 16.7%~100%) and no one has worsened seizure frequency after DBS. Five patients had less than 50% seizure frequency reduction. Relative location within the nucleus in responder group was more anterior than in non-responder (4.7 vs 5.2) however no statistical significance was found. Responders' locations were more anterior than non-responders' based on mtt (0.44 mm vs 0.38 mm anterior to mtt). However, distance from mtt was significantly related to clinical outcome, as responders were 3.4 mm from mtt and non-responders had 6 mm distance from mtt (p=0.02). Conclusion(s): In our series, we found clinical outcome to be strongly related to the distance of active contact from mtt. Thus, mtt should be targeted to achieve good seizure control after ATN DBS.",19,,,

177,"Introduction: Anterior thalamic (ANT) deep brain stimulation (DBS) has recently been introduced as a therapy for medical refractory epilepsy. We intended to detect stimulation induced cortical activity related to treatment response. Method(s): We investigated seven patients with ANT-DBS (145 Hz, 90 [Formula presented] s, 3-5 V) with 64-channel EEG during cycling stimulation (1 min on; 5 min off). Stimulation induced changes of cortical oscillatory activity and clinical response to a four month treatment were analyzed using two-factor type III ANOVA. Result(s): We found significant interactions between stimulation on/off and response-type in the cortical [Formula presented] -band in three responders (seizures originating in the temporal lobe; 77%, 71%, 59.5% median seizure count reduction) and four non-responders (extratemporal seizure origins; 25%, 8%, 5.5%, -3.5%). EEG-electrodes F5, FC1, FT7, P2, and P4 regions showed significant power reductions after multiple-comparison correction. A widespread significant [Formula presented] -band reduction during stimulation in responders, but not in non-responders was revealed in subsequent one-way ANOVAs. Discussion(s): In order to better understand the mechanisms of ANT-DBS, aid patient selection, and optimize treatment success, further studies regarding the stimulation-induced changes of neurophysiological activity are warranted. Electrodes placement in ANT-DBS may be informed by intraoperative acquisition of stimulation induced cortical changes.Copyright © 2019",7,,5.0,

179,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) is a promising treatment for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, therapy response varies and precise positioning of the DBS lead is potentially essential for maximizing therapeutic efficacy. We investigate if single-cell recordings acquired by microelectrode recordings can aid targeting of the ANT during surgery and hypothesize that the neuronal firing properties of the target region relate to clinical outcome. We prospectively included 10 refractory epilepsy patients and performed microelectrode recordings under general anesthesia to identify the change in neuronal signals when approaching and transecting the ANT. The neuronal firing properties of the target region, anatomical locations of microelectrode recordings and active contact positions of the DBS lead along the recorded trajectory were compared between responders and nonresponders to DBS. We obtained 19 sets of recordings from 10 patients (five responders and five nonresponders). Amongst the 403 neurons detected, 365 (90.6%) were classified as bursty. Entry into the ANT was characterized by an increase in firing rate while exit of the ANT was characterized by a decrease in firing rate. Comparing the trajectories of responders to nonresponders, we found differences neither in the neuronal firing properties themselves nor in their locations relative to the position of the active contact. Single-cell firing rate acquired by microelectrode recordings under general anesthesia can thus aid targeting of the ANT during surgery, but is not related to clinical outcome in DBS for patients with refractory epilepsy.",10,,,
180,"Chronically implantable neurostimulation devices are becoming a clinically viable option for treating patients with neurological disease and psychiatric disorders. Neurostimulation offers the ability to probe and manipulate distributed networks of interacting brain areas in dysfunctional circuits. Here, we use tools from network control theory to examine the dynamic reconfiguration of functionally interacting neuronal ensembles during targeted neurostimulation of cortical and subcortical brain structures. By integrating multimodal intracranial recordings and diffusion-weighted imaging from patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, we test hypothesized structural and functional rules that predict altered patterns of synchronized local field potentials. We demonstrate the ability to predictably reconfigure functional interactions depending on stimulation strength and location. Stimulation of areas with structurally weak connections largely modulates the functional hubness of downstream areas and concurrently propels the brain towards more difficult-to-reach dynamical states. By using focal perturbations to bridge large-scale structure, function, and markers of behavior, our findings suggest that stimulation may be tuned to influence different scales of network interactions driving cognition.Copyright © 2019 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",0,,,
181,"Background: Results of DBS of ATN in refractory epilepsy depend on accuracy of the electrode's location. We searched for characteristic intraoperative, intracerebral EEG recording pattern from anterior thalamic nuclei (ATNs) as a biological marker for verifying the electrode's position. Method(s): There were six patients with refractory epilepsy scheduled for deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedure. At surgery, to map the target, we recorded EEG from each lead of DBS electrodes. One patient underwent a 24 hours EEG with continuous recording from both ATNs before internalization of stimulator units. Result(s): In all patients we recorded spontaneous bioelectric activity of ATNs. The pattern of the recording from the ATN was similar in all cases. In the one patient where 24-hour recording was done with simultaneous scalp EEG, a complex partial seizure was captured. Conclusion(s): This is the first report of using DBS electrode for intraoperative EEG recordings from the ATN in patients with refractory epilepsy. Since we managed to find the characteristic pattern of bioelectric activity of ATN, this technique seems to be a promising method for targeting this structure during the operation.Copyright © 2018",6,,,
182,"Objectives: Neurostimulation has offered new treatment options in refractory epilepsy, first with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and more recently with deep brain stimulation (DBS). There is a lack of previous detailed data assessing the relationship between VNS and ANT-DBS. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential correlation between therapeutic responses to VNS and ANT-DBS. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 11 patients with previous VNS therapy underwent ANT-DBS implantation. Monthly seizure counts starting from baseline before VNS extending to long-term DBS treatment were analyzed. The reasons for VNS discontinuation were assessed. Result(s): Altogether in 10 of 11 patients, the response to VNS seemed to be similar to the response to DBS therapy. Progressive response to VNS was likely to correlate with a progressive response to DBS in three of three patients. Partial response to VNS was associated with a fluctuating response pattern to DBS in two patients. Five of six nonresponders to VNS were also nonresponders to DBS. One of the VNS nonresponders obtained progressive response to DBS. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to evaluate in detail the effect of both VNS and ANT-DBS in refractory epilepsy patients. There is a putative association between VNS and DBS responses suggesting the need for further studies.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",11,,,
183,"Objective: Conflicting conclusions have been reported regarding predictors of deep brain stimulation (DBS) outcome in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The main goal of this meta-analysis study was to identify possible predictors of remarkable seizure reduction (RSR). Method(s): We conducted a comprehensive search of English-language literature published since 1990 and indexed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library that addressed seizure outcomes in patients who underwent DBS for refractory TLE. A pooled RSR rate was determined for eight included studies. RSR rates were analyzed relative to potential prognostic variables. Random- or fixed-effects models were used depending on the presence or absence of heterogeneity. Result(s): The pooled RSR rate among 61 DBS-treated patients with TLE from 8 studies was 59%. Higher likelihood of RSR was found to be associated with lateralization of stimulation, lateralized ictal EEG findings, and a longer follow-up period. Seizure semiology, MRI abnormalities, and patient sex were not predictive of RSR rate. The best electrode type for RSR was the Medtronic 3389. Hippocampal and anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) sites of stimulation had similar odds of producing RSR. Conclusion(s): DBS is an effective therapeutic modality for intractable TLE, particularly in patients with lateralized EEG abnormalities and in patients treated on the ictal side. This meta-analysis provides evidence-based information for determining DBS suitability in presurgical counseling and for explaining seizure outcomes.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",61,,,
184,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may represent a valuable tool for investigating important neurophysiological and pathophysiological aspects of myoclonus. Moreover, repetitive TMS (rTMS) can influence neural activity. In this review we performed a systematic search of all studies using TMS in order to explore cortical excitability/plasticity and rTMS for the treatment of myoclonus due to different aetiologies. We identified and reviewed 40 articles matching the inclusion criteria; 415 patients were included in these studies. The reviewed TMS studies have detected abnormalities in motor cortex excitability and sensorimotor plasticity. The most consistent finding is a decrease in intracortical inhibition. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is reduced in myoclonic epilepsies. Unlike the juvenile and the benign myoclonus epilepsy, long-interval intracortical inhibition, interhemispheric inhibition and sensorimotor integration were altered in patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsies. In patients with myoclonus-dystonia the results are partly conflicting. Cortical membrane excitability was impaired while parameters assessing cortical synaptic activity were normal in DYT11 gene carriers. In other studies normal SICI suggests that the GABAergic cortical circuits are largely intact and that the mechanisms of myoclonus-dystonia are different from those for cortical myoclonus and other dystonic disorders. In conclusion, different TMS study protocols have provided new insights into sensorimotor plasticity and cortical excitability of the different forms of myoclonus, and have shed some light on the pathophysiology of this movement disorder. Well-defined motor cortical excitability patterns can be identified in the different disorders characterized by myoclonus, even if preliminary findings should be confirmed in future studies in larger cohorts of patients. Repetitive TMS might have therapeutic potential at least in some patients with myoclonus, similar to that reported in other neurological and psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2018",415,,,
185,"Background: Neuromodulatory applications such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) are safe and effective strategies for medically intractable epilepsy secondary to complex partial seizures, but researchers have yet to compare their efficacies. Objective(s): The goal of this study is to compare VNS and RNS efficacy at reducing seizure frequency and complication rates in subjects with medically intractable epilepsy secondary to complex partial seizures. Method(s): This is a retrospective chart review of 30 patients with medically intractable complex partial epilepsy, who underwent either VNS or RNS placement at a single institution between June 2012 and January 2016. There was a mean follow-up of 19 months. Seizure frequency reduction and complications were identified. Result(s): The median seizure frequency reduction was similar for VNS (66%) and RNS (58%). There was no major morbidity or mortality, and the frequency of minor complications was similar between VNS (15%) and RNS (18%). Conclusion(s): We found that VNS and RNS reduced the median seizure frequency similarly with no difference in morbidity or mortality. Further prospective studies are warranted as VNS and RNS therapy improves over time.Copyright © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.",30,,,
186,"Purpose: Using direct intracerebral electrical stimulation (ES) in epileptic patients to evoke symptoms to help identify the functional neuroanatomy of the insular lobe and opercula. Method(s): We selected 43 patients who had at least 1 electrode inserted into the insula or opercula via an oblique approach among 135 patients with intractable epilepsy. Bipolar stimulation was chosen, and the stimulation parameters of the biphasic waves included a pulse width of 0.2 ms, a frequency of 50 Hz, a duration of 3 s, and an intensity gradually increasing from 0.5 to 4 mA. Result(s): In total, 93 electrodes were implanted into the insula or insular opercula, and 169 of 281 contacts (60.1%) evoked 212 responses by ES of the insula. 142 responses were induced by stimulating the insular opercula in 126 of 343 sites (36.7%). Usual responses, such as somatosensory, visceral sensory, speech, auditory, and motor responses, were evoked. In addition, rarely reported responses, including cardiovascular symptoms (tachycardia), visual symptoms evoked by ES of the parietal and temporal opercula, and vestibular symptoms (like the loss of ownership of the body) evoked following stimulation of the posterior insula and parietal operculum, were also induced in our study. Conclusion(s): The insula and opercula perform various and complicated functions. The posterior insula and parietal operculum could play important roles in body-ownership symptoms. The complicated visual phenomena were partially related to the temporal operculum.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",135,,,4.0
187,"Objective: Anterior nucleus of thalamus (ANT) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is becoming a more common treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. Epilepsy and depression display a bidirectional association. Anterior nucleus of thalamus has connections to anterior cingulate cortex and orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, hence, a possible role in emotional and executive functions, and thus, ANT DBS might exert psychiatric adverse effects. Our aim was to evaluate previous and current psychiatric symptoms in patients with epilepsy undergoing ANT DBS surgery and assess the predictability of psychiatric adverse effects. Programming-related psychiatric adverse effects are also reported. Method(s): Twenty-two patients with ANT DBS for retractable epilepsy were examined, and a psychiatric evaluation of depressive and other psychiatric symptoms was performed with Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Symptom Checklist prior to surgery, concentrating on former and current psychiatric symptoms and medications. The follow-up visit was one year after surgery. Result(s): At the group level, no changes on mood were observed during ANT DBS treatment. Two patients with former histories of depression experienced sudden depressive symptoms related to DBS programming settings; these were quickly alleviated after changing the stimulation parameters. In addition, two patients with no previous histories of psychosis gradually developed clear paranoid and anxiety symptoms that also relieved slowly after changing the programming settings. Conclusion(s): The majority of our ANT DBS patients did not experience psychiatric adverse effects. Certain DBS parameters might predispose to sudden depressive or slowly manifesting paranoid symptoms that are reversible via programming changes.Copyright © 2018 The Authors",22,,,
188,"Background: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of treatment with transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) for patients with refractory epilepsy by evaluation of the frequency of seizures, electroencephalogram (EEG) changes, and quality of life on follow-up at three months and six months. Material/Methods: EEG evaluation followed baseline evaluation with EEG at three months and six months following tVNS treatment. The frequency of seizures was recorded during the six-month study period. Before and after tVNS treatment, patients completed the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale (LSSS), the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31), and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Result(s): Seventeen patients completed six months of tVNS treatment. Following three months of tVNS therapy, the frequency of epileptic seizures decreased in 13/17 subjects, with an average reduced seizure rate of 31.3%. Following six months of tVNS treatment, the frequency of epileptic seizures decreased in 16/17 subjects, with an average reduced seizure rate of 64.4%. There were 14/17 cases with abnormal EEG at baseline; 2/17 patients had improved EEGs by three months, and 10/17 patients had improved EEGs by six months. During the study period, there were no adverse events associated with tVNS treatment, but the effects on sleep were inconclusive. Conclusion(s): This preliminary study showed that tVNS was an effective and safe adjuvant treatment for refractory epilepsy that reduced seizure frequency and reduced abnormal EEG changes following clinical improvement.Copyright © Med Sci Monit,.",17,,,
189,"Approximately 30% of individuals with epilepsy are refractory to antiepileptic drugs and currently approved neuromodulatory approaches fall short of providing seizure freedom for many individuals with limited utility for generalized seizures. Here, we expand on previous findings and investigate whether ventral pallidum deep brain stimulation (VP-DBS) can be efficacious for various acute seizure phenotypes. For rats administered pilocarpine, we found that VP-DBS (50 Hz) decreased generalized stage 4/5 seizure median frequency from 9 to 6 and total duration from 1667 to 264 s even after generalized seizures emerged. The transition to brainstem seizures was prevented in almost all animals. VP-DBS immediately after rats exhibited their first partial forebrain stage 3 seizure did not affect the frequency of partial seizures but reduced median partial seizure duration from 271 to 54 s. Stimulation after partial seizures also reduced the occurrence and duration of secondarily generalized stage 4/5 seizures. VP-DBS prior to pilocarpine administration prevented the appearance of partial seizures in almost all animals. Lastly, VP-DBS delayed the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) from 111 to 823 s in rats administered another chemoconvulsant, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 90 mg/kg). In this particular rat seizure model, stimulating electrodes placed more laterally in both VP hemispheres and more posterior in the left VP hemisphere provided greatest efficacy for GTCSs. In conclusion, our findings posit that VP-DBS can serve as an effective novel neuromodulatory approach for a variety of acute seizure phenotypes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",0,,,
190,"Background: The use of the anterior nucleus of thalamus (ANT) as a target for treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy is based on its crucial role in seizure propagation. We describe results of chronic bilateral ANT stimulation and bilateral ANT lesions in 31 patients with refractory epilepsy. Method(s): ANT DBS was performed in 12 patients (group I) and bilateral stereotactic radiofrequency lesions of ANT were performed in 19 patients (group II). Targeting was based on stereotactic atlas information with correction of the final coordinates according to the location of anatomical landmarks and intraoperative microelectrode recording data. Result(s): Both groups were similar in age, gender, seizures frequency, and duration of disease. The median x, y, and z coordinates of ANT were found to be 2.9, 5, and 11 mm anterior, lateral, and superior to the mid-commissural point, respectively. Mean seizures reduction reached 80.3% in group of patients with ANT DBS with two nonresponders and 91.2% in group of patients with lesions. Five patients from group I and three patients from group II became seizure-free. The morbidity rate was low in both groups. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic anterior thalamotomy and chronic ANT stimulation are both effective for seizure control in epilepsy originated from frontal and temporal lobes. ANT lesions and stimulation were more effective for secondary-generalized seizures compared to simple partial seizures.Copyright © 2018 Surgical Neurology International Published by Wolters Kluwer Medknow.",31,,,
191,"We report a case of medically refractory anti-GAD encephalitis which was treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) after seizure termination was achieved using cortical stimulation during stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) evaluation. The patient underwent bilateral SEEG implantation and cortical stimulation. Upon stimulation, mimicking the intrinsic seizures (at 1 Hz), it was possible to induce seizures with typical semiology, on multiple attempts. Stimulation during these seizures with high frequency (50 Hz) resulted in complete termination of the seizure. DBS was inserted after the SEEG evaluation, targeting the bilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. There was a sustained reduction in seizure frequency and severity 12 months post insertion. There were also improvements in quality of life. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case reported in which DBS was successfully used to treat refractory epilepsy in a patient with seizures that were proven to be responsive to electrical stimulation during SEEG recording.Copyright © 2018 Epileptic Disorders",1,,,
192,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) could become a palliative treatment for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy for which surgery cannot be proposed. The objective of this study was to perform microstimulation to measure the effects of DBS in epilepsy locally at the level of a few neurons, with microelectrode recordings, for the first time in patients with epilepsy. Microelectrode recordings were performed before, during and after microstimulation in nine patients with refractory epilepsy. Neuronal spikes were successfully extracted from multi-unit recordings with clustering in six out of seven patients during hippocampal and in one out of two patients during cortical dysplasia microstimulation (1 Hz, charge-balanced biphasic waveform, 60 micros/ph, 25 microA). The firing rates increased in four out of the six periods of microstimulation that could be analyzed. The firing rates were found higher than before microstimulation in all eight periods with increases reaching significance in six out of eight periods. Low-frequency microstimulation was hence sufficient to induce neuronal excitation lasting beyond the stimulation period. No inhibition was observed. This report presents the first evidence that microstimulation performed in epileptic patients produced locally neuronal excitation. Hence neuronal excitation is shown here as the local mechanism of action of DBS. This local excitation is in agreement with epileptogenic effects of low-frequency hippocampal macrostimulation.Copyright © 2018 Bartoli, Tyrand, Vargas, Momjian and Boex.",9,,,
193,"Introduction: Stimulation-evoked focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (FBTCS) can be a stressful and possibly harmful adverse event for patients during cortical stimulation (CS). We evaluated if drug load reduction of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during CS increases the risk of stimulation-evoked FBTCS. Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective cohort study, we searched our local database for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent invasive video-EEG monitoring and CS in the University Hospital la Fe Valencia from January 2006 to November 2016. The AED drug load was calculated with the defined daily dose. We applied a uni- and multivariate logistic regression model to estimate the risk of stimulation-evoked FBTCS and evaluate possible influencing factors. Furthermore, we compared patients whose AEDs were completely withdrawn with those whose AEDs were not. Result(s): Fifty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Stimulating 3806 electrode contact pairs, 152 seizures were evoked in 28 patients (48.3%). Ten seizures (6.6%) in seven patients (12.1%) evolved to FBTCS. In the univariate and multivariate analysis, a 10% reduction in drug load was associated with an increase of the odds ratio (OR) of stimulation-evoked FBTCS by 1.9 (95%-CI 1.2, 4.0, p-value = 0.04) and 1.9 (95%-CI 1.2, 4.6, p-value = 0.04), respectively. In patients, whose AEDs were completely withdrawn the OR of FBTCS increased by 9.1 (95%CI 1.7, 69.9, p-value = 0.01) compared with patients whose AEDs were not completely withdrawn. No other factor (implantation type, maximum stimulus intensity, number of stimulated contacts, history of FBTCS, age, gender, or epilepsy type) appears to have a significant effect on the risk of stimulation-evoked FBTCS. Conclusion(s): The overall risk of stimulation-evoked FBTCS during CS is relatively low. However, a stronger reduction and, especially, a complete withdrawal of AEDs are associated with an increased risk of stimulation-evoked FBTCS.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",58,,,
194,"The authors present a case of an out-of- body experience (OBE) that occurred in a child with intractable epilepsy when stimulating the anterior insular cortex (AIC) by intracranial electrodes. After destroying several sites precisely located at the left AIC by radiofrequency thermocoagulation, the patient's seizures disappeared, and the OBE could not be reproduced when repeatedly stimulating these sites. To our knowledge, it has never been reported that an OBE occurred in the AIC. We analyze the mechanism of an OBE mostly appearing in temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and propose two perspectives for a possible mechanism involving the AIC causing the OBE.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",0,,,
195,"Objective: The goal of this study was to assess the indications of revision for vagal nerve stimulation at a single institution in an adult population with drug-resistant epilepsy. Method(s): This was a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database who underwent vagal nerve stimulator implantation for drug-resistant epilepsy during 1992-2017. Patients receiving vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) implants were monitored throughout their perioperative and postoperative course and were classified according to type of seizure at the time of diagnosis and indications for VNS revision. In addition, response to dysfunctional VNS devices or adverse effects were noted. Result(s): Most patients receiving VNS implants were given a diagnosis of complex partial seizures (CPSs) before implantation (95.1%). Other epileptic conditions identified requiring implantation included generalized seizures, generalized-atonic seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, CPS or generalized seizures, and tuberous sclerosis (with generalized characteristics). High lead impedance was the most common indication for revision (5.6%), whereas device ineffectiveness leading to continued seizures was the most common indication for removal (2.3%). Infection, lead fracture, and dual- to single-pin lead battery changes occurred at an incidence of 1.9%, requiring either implant removal or revision. Other events that occurred, albeit rarely, included skin extrusion (0.5%), postoperative hematoma (0.5%), and implant rejection (0.5%) necessitating removal. Conclusion(s): VNS implantation in adults was shown to be a well-tolerated procedure. In addition, indications for revision or removal of the VNS device was low in this population with lead fracture rates lower than the incidence reported in pediatric population literature.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",0,,,
196,"The SANTE (Stimulation of Anterior Nucleus of Thalamus for Epilepsy) trial (7) demonstrated that the stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) decreases the frequency of refractory epileptic seizures. A significant reduction of epileptic seizures can also be achieved with electrical stimulation of the Hippocampus (8,10,16,19,32). The hippocampus as a target and other DBS targets are not in clinical use in Germany. The benefits shown in the SANTE trial could not be reproduced to its full extent after a 7-year use in Germany.

197,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of thalamus (ANT) is an emerging treatment option for patients suffering from refractory epilepsy. ANT has extensive connections with hippocampus and retrosplenial cingulum, areas associated mainly with spatial memory and with anterior cingulum which is important in executive functions. As refractory epilepsy is often associated with cognitive decline and neuronal damage, the decreased connectivity between ANT and remote structures might impact on the effects of DBS. Objective(s): We hypothesized that the neuropsychological profile could reflect the connectivity of ANT and further predict the efficacy of ANT DBS. We evaluated the cognitive performance of patients with refractory epilepsy with DBS to evaluate whether neuropsychological profiles could reflect the connectivity of ANT and further predict the efficacy of ANT DBS. Method(s): Sixteen patients with refractory epilepsy treated with ANT DBS with at least 2 years of follow-up were included in the study. Patients underwent a neuropsychological evaluation as a part of the protocol and their clinical outcome was determined by seizure frequency in the last 6 months compared to baseline. The patients were classified as responders if there was a >=50% reduction in the frequency of the predominant seizure type, otherwise as nonresponders. Result(s): There were 12 responders and 4 nonresponders for ANT DBS treatment in the study population. Nonresponders performed worse than responders in neuropsychological tasks measuring executive functions and attention, such as the Trail-Making Test. Conclusion(s): Better executive functions and attention seemed to predict improved clinical outcome after the ANT DBS surgery. Based on our preliminary descriptive findings and the anatomical connectivity hypothesis, we suggest that deficits in executive functions may relate to an inferior outcome. This finding might offer new tools for refining the selection of patients with refractory epilepsy scheduled to undergo ANT DBS surgery. Moreover, it highlights the need for further investigations of neural connectivity in epilepsy.Copyright © 2018 Jarvenpaa, Rosti-Otajarvi, Rainesalo, Laukkanen, Lehtimaki and Peltola.",16,,,

199,"Deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is an effective treatment for patients with refractory epilepsy who do not respond sufficiently to medical therapy. Optimal therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation probably depend on accurate positioning of the stimulating electrodes.

Deep brain stimulation electrodes in epilepsy patients are implanted under general anesthesia. The type and depth of anesthesia might interfere with microelectrode ecordings.

200,"Objectives: In patients with epilepsy, multiple factors such as ictal frequency, interictal activity and anticonvulsant therapy affect sleep architecture and quality. Daytime somnolence is the most common complaint of patients with epilepsy. An increase in obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome has been documented in patients with refractory epilepsy, associated with a decline in the quality of life. We wanted to review of the literature on the effects of three invasive procedures used in certain cases of refractory epilepsy: vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS) and epilepsy surgery, in subjective and objective sleep parameters. Method(s): We performed a literature search in all the main medical databases: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, DARE and LILACS, looking for studies that evaluated the effects of VNS, DBS or epilepsy surgery on sleep parameters. Result(s): In all, 36 studies, coming from 11 countries, including reviews, cohort studies, case series and case reports were included. VNS seems to induce sleep apnea, depending on stimulation variables. This condition can be reverted modifying these settings. Surgical procedures for epilepsy has been associated with an improvement in objective and subjective sleep parameters, that depend on the success of the procedure evaluated through ictal frequency control. There is evidence that non-pharmacologic treatment of epilepsy has different effects on sleep patterns. Conclusion(s): It is advisable to include objective and subjective sleep parameters in the initial evaluation and follow-up of patients considered for invasive procedures for epilepsy control, especially with VNS, due to the risk of sleep apnea. Most information comes from observational studies, with small sample sizes. More high quality studies are needed.Copyright © 2018",0,,,
201,"Objective: In children with medically-refractory focal epilepsy, undergoing nTMS for pre-surgical motor mapping, we test whether maturation of the resting motor threshold (rMT), a measure of corticospinal excitability, is distinct in male and female patients. Method(s): 88 children (46m, 4.8y-17.7y; 42f, 4.1y-17.8y) with intractable epilepsy underwent nTMS for functional mapping prior to epilepsy surgery. Bilateral rMT, defined as the minimal stimulation intensity necessary to elicit a response from the APB muscle contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere, of 50 muV, on>50% of trials was measured per patient. Only patients with a (1) focal, unilateral seizure onset zone (2) rMT<100% machine-output and (3) <=18y, were included. Per subject, data were analyzed separately for the ""epileptic"" and ""healthy"" hemisphere. Result(s): In the healthy hemisphere of boys and girls, age is the major determinant ofrMT, which decreases by 9V/m per year throughout childhood (p<.0001). In contrast, the maturational trajectory is distinct between boys and girls in the epileptic hemisphere. Specifically, whereas boys maintain the same maturational trajectory in both healthy and epileptic hemispheres, average rMT in the epileptic hemisphere is lower (p<.0001), and the rMT maturational trajectory (rMTv.age R2=.002; p=.754) is absent in girls. A major distinction among (Figure presented) rMTs measured in the epileptic hemisphere is between young boys and girls (<=12y), where rMT is significantly lower (p<0.0001) in young girls (n=22, average rMT; 113.1+/-36.49) than in young boys (n=22, average rMT; 166.4+/-41.5). Further, in young girls, rMT in the epileptic hemisphere is significantly lower (p<0.0001) than in the healthy hemisphere (mean, 109.15V/m+/-35.7; 143.67V/m+/-60.0, respectively). Conclusion(s): Distinct average rMTs in boys and girls with focal epilepsy indicate that sex is a determinant of the effects that either seizures, epileptogenesis, or both, have on measures of corticospinal excitability.",0,,143.67,
202,"Objective: To describe a rare case of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) masking seizure in a Parkinson's Disease (PD) patient. Background(s): Not applicable. Design/Methods: A case report. Result(s): A 77 year old caucasian female with PD receives a DBS targeting bilateral GPi nuclei with activation of the right lead only. She has no history of seizure. Approximately one year after DBS placement she is admitted for treatment of acute onset Bipolar mania. During her hospital stay, she becomes catatonic with rare episodes of left head turning and rigidity. The initial EEG shows a diffuse 60 hertz artifact. The DBS is turned off due to concern for possible behavioral side effects after which EEG reveals multiple right focal seizures with secondary generalization. A brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan shows hypermetabolic activity surrounding the right DBS lead and ipsilateral frontal cortex. Despite multiple anti-epileptic drug (AED) trials, it is not until the DBS is turned back on that the seizures are controlled. The patient reports at the time of follow up she is non-compliant with AEDs. She is exclusively maintained on right lead DBS activation. No further seizure activity is reported. Conclusion(s): Deep brain stimulation for the management of intractable epilepsy has acquired extensive attention recently for its results targeting different areas of the brain. Trials targeting the hippocampus and cortex by responsive neural stimulation (RNS) and DBS targeting the anterior nucleus of the thalamus have shown notable success. Among the targets investigated, the basal ganglia has yet to be extensively studied outside of animal models. This case is a novel example of successful seizure suppression in a patient with GPi lead placement. Prior animal studies suggest neuromodulation of the GPi and its network within the human brain merits further clinical studies in regards to the treatment of intractable epilepsy.",1,,,
203,"Purpose Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) reduces seizures and is relatively safe but may be accompanied by complaints of memory problems and depression. This study examined incidence of memory and depression adverse events (AE) in the SANTE study blinded phase and their relationship to objective neurobehavioral measures, baseline characteristics, quality of life and long-term neurobehavioral outcome. Method The neurobehavioral AE and neuropsychological data from a previously reported prospective randomized trial (SANTE) were analyzed. Reliable change indices (RCI) were calculated for memory and mood measures. Analyses examined relationships among AEs, RCIs, demographic and seizure variables, and long-term neurobehavioral outcome. Results No significant cognitive declines or worsening of depression scores were observed through the blinded phase or in open-label at 7-years. Higher scores were observed at 7 years on measures of executive functions and attention. Depression and memory-related AEs were not associated with reliable change on objective measures or 7-year neurobehavioral outcome. The AEs were without significant impact on life quality. Memory and depression AEs were not related to demographic or seizure characteristics, change in seizure frequency, frequency of AE or depression report. Conclusion Bilateral ANT DBS was associated with subjective depression and memory AEs during the blinded phase in a minority of patients that were not accompanied by objective, long-term neurobehavioral worsening. Monitoring and neuropsychological assessment of depression and memory are recommended from a theoretical standpoint and because more memory and depression AEs occurred in the active stimulation than control group.Copyright © 2016 British Epilepsy Association",0,,,
204,"OBJECTIVE Thalamic stimulation can provoke electroencephalography (EEG) synchronization or desynchronization, which can help to reduce the occurrence of seizures in intractable epilepsy, though the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Therefore, the authors investigated changes in EEG electrical activity to better understand the seizurereducing effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with intractable epilepsy. METHODS Electrical activation patterns in the epileptogenic brains of 3 patients were analyzed using classical lowresolution electromagnetic tomography analysis recursively applied (CLARA). Electrical activity recorded during thalamic stimulation was compared with that recorded during the preoperative and postoperative off-stimulation states in patients who underwent anterior thalamic nucleus DBS for intractable epilepsy. RESULTS Interictal EEG was fully synchronized to the frequency in the postoperative on-stimulation period. The CLARA showed that electrical activity during preoperative and postoperative off-stimulation states was localized in cortical and subcortical areas, including the insular, middle frontal, mesial temporal, and precentral areas. No electrical activity was localized in deep nucleus structures. However, with CLARA, electrical activity in the postoperative on-stimulation period was localized in the anterior cingulate area, basal ganglia, and midbrain. CONCLUSIONS Anterior thalamic stimulation could spread electrical current to the underlying neuronal networks that connect with the thalamus, which functions as a cortical pacemaker. Consequently, the thalamus could modify electrical activity within these neuronal networks and influence cortical EEG activity by inducing neuronal synchronization between the thalamus and cortical structures.Copyright © AANS, 2017.",3,,,

We report on a white Afrikaans family from eastern South Africa with three members affected with North Sea progressive myoclonus epilepsy, resulting from a homozygous founder GOSR2 mutation (c.430G>T, p.Gly144Trp). The mutation was identified by exomic sequencing in a research study investigating childhood onset ataxias. All three subjects presented with ataxia, tremor, early gait difficulties, and myoclonic and generalized tonic clonic (GTC) epilepsy. Each patient underwent deep brain stimulation of the caudal Zona Incerta before coming to the attention of the authors. In each case there was a reduction in GTC seizures, and two patients exhibited a reduction in involuntary movements, as evaluated during long-term follow-up. In one case there was an improvement in gait and stance when assessed while the stimulation was on.Copyright © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",3,,,
206,"Introduction: Approximately one third of patients with focal epilepsy continue to have ongoing seizures despite adequate trials of anti-seizure medications. Surgery to remove the epileptogenic zone remains the most efficacious treatment option for focal drug-resistant epilepsy. However, when cortical areas are eloquent or there are multiple epileptogenic zones, surgical resection is not an ideal approach. Cortical stimulation provides an attractive alternative. Area covered: Here, the authors describe Chronic Subthreshold Cortical Stimulation (CSCS), which uses continuous intracranial electrical stimulation applied near the epileptogenic zone to lower seizure probability. The authors review literature related to CSCS. One challenge is finding the most efficacious set of stimulation parameters for each patient. Expert commentary: Data supporting CSCS are limited but promising for the treatment of patients with focal drug resistant epilepsy who are not surgical candidates. Additional electrophysiological biomarkers to estimate cortical excitability are needed.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0,,,
207,"Purpose Anterior thalamic deep brain stimulation (ATN DBS) is an emerging, effective treatment for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, but long-term results on its efficacy and safety are lacking. To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of ATN DBS treatment, as well as predictors of its success, in patients with drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE). Method We retrospectively studied clinical outcomes in 29 consecutive refractory epilepsy patients treated by a single DBS team (two neurosurgeons, four neurologists) over an 11-year period, for whom follow-up was performed for up to 137 months (mean, 74.9 months). Results The average participant was 30.7 (+/-10.4) years old and had epilepsy for 19.3 (+/-9.0) years. The mean preoperative frequency of disabling partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures was 27.5 (+/-8.6, SE) seizures a month. The median percent seizure reduction was 71.3% at 1 year, 73.9% at 2 years, and ranged from 61.8% to 80.0% over post-implant years 3 through 11 in the long-term study (overall 70% median reduction). In the 11-year study period, 13.8% (4/29) of subjects were seizure-free for at least 12 months during this time. There was only one symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage that happened during follow-up (3.4%). Infection requiring removal and later re-implantation of hardware occurred in only 1 of 30 patients (3.3%), who was subsequently excluded from our follow-up assessment. Hardware malfunction including lead disconnection occurred in 2 of 29 cases (6.9%). Revision of lead position to redeem poor clinical response was performed in 3 of 58 implanted leads (5.2%). Conclusions ATN DBS can be an effective therapy in a variety of patients with DRE. Importantly, we provide evidence that significant therapeutic efficacy can be sustained for up to 11 years. Neurological complications were rather rare, but long-term hardware-related complications should be followed arrectis auribus.Copyright © 2017 British Epilepsy Association",30,,,
208,"Introduction Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive technique for investigating cortical physiologic functions in the brain. In this study, the effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) on motor evoked potential (MEP) parameters in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) were investigated. Materials and methods Fifteen patients with IGE were included. Motor threshold (MT) and cortical silent period (CSP) were determined before cTBS application. Next, cTBS was applied to the dominant (left) hemisphere M1 hand area as the first application. After 1 day, cTBS was applied first to the left M1 hand area and then to the right lateral cerebellar area as the second application. Parameters were again determined after the applications. Results There was no difference in resting MT values before and after cTBS application (p > 0.05). Although CSP increased after stimulation (p < 0.05), it was not significantly different between applications (p > 0.05). Conclusion For patients with epilepsy, cTBS is a safe technique when applied at a low intensity. The inhibitory effect of cTBS, a noninvasive technique, on cortical excitability in patients with IGE was determined using MEP parameters. The effect lasted at least 1 h. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the effect of cTBS on cortical excitability in patients with IGE. Our findings indicate that cTBS decreases cortical excitability in patients with IGE.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",15,,,
209,"Background: The Hemiconvulsions-Hemiplegia-Epilepsy (HHE) syndrome is currently regarded as an extremely rare condition. The etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this medical rarity as well as the optimal therapeutic approaches remain poorly defined and understood. We present the clinical, radiological and electroencephalography (EEG) findings of a patient with the HHE syndrome and describe the response of the continuously present epileptiform abnormalities to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Case description: A 33-year old male patient was referred to our department for investigation and management of intractable epilepsy. His seizures began at the age of three months when, during the course of a common febrile illness, he developed repetitive clonic seizures involving the left upper and lower limbs, followed by permanent left hemiplegia. After extensive investigations, he was diagnosed with ""idiopathic"" HHE syndrome. Currently, he suffers from left hemiplegia, severe intellectual impairment [Intelligence Quotient (IQ) <30] and asymmetric, bilateral tonic seizures occurring 1-3 times daily despite treatment with valproate, topiramate, lamotrigine, rufinamide, and perampanel. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed atrophy of the right hemisphere and serial EEGs disclosed continuous sharp waves, the generators of which were localized by electrical source imaging (ESI) to two distinct sources within the right hemisphere. Repetitive TMS [210 stimuli of 1 Hz at 100 % corticomotor threshold applied with a circular coil over the generators of epileptic discharges (EDs)] resulted in a statistically significant decrease of ED counts compared to sham stimulation and the post-verum TMS period. Conclusion(s): We present the clinical-laboratory profile and the long-term follow up of a patient with the HHE syndrome. Further, we describe the effects of TMS on EDs. The latter observation raises the possibility that TMS-EEG may be used in select cases with intractable epilepsy as a surrogate marker of responsiveness to more invasive modalities (i.e., cortical stimulation).Copyright © 2017, Lithografia Antoniadis I - Psarras Th G.P..

210,"Neuromodulation techniques targeting limbic circuits can be used to treat refractory psychiatric or neurological disorders. However, objective measure for the impact of neuromodulation on affective brain circuits is lacking. Deep brain stimulation at a key node of the limbic circuit, the anterior thalamic nuclei (ANT-DBS), is used to treat refractory epilepsy. While effective in reducing seizures, patients have reported subjective depressive symptoms as a side effect. In line with potential vulnerability to depression, we have previously shown ANT-DBS to increase attention allocation to threat evidenced by behavior and brain physiology. Rightward frontal alpha asymmetry with greater right hemispheric activation is thought to reflect brain physiology linked with depression and anxiety. To that end, we investigated whether high-frequency electric stimulation at ANT influences frontal alpha asymmetry. Furthermore, we explored the impact of DBS on emotional modulation of frontal alpha asymmetry and whether it is linked with emotional modulation of response speed. Electrical stimulation at ANT led to an increased rightward frontal alpha asymmetry compared to situations where stimulation was off (F(1,12) = 14.09, p = 0.003) or the thalamic control location was stimulated (F(1,12) = 10.19, p = 0.008), along with prolonged reaction times in the context of emotional distractors (F(1,7) = 16.66, p = 0.005). The change was specifically driven by increased activity in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, we found a correlation between the emotional modulation of frontal alpha asymmetry and emotional interference of response speed due to ANT stimulation (r = 0.78, p = 0.02). In conclusion, DBS at ANT increased relative right hemispheric activity and this was linked with emotional modulation of behavior. Previous studies have linked frontal alpha asymmetry with emotion related symptoms and furthermore, Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) has been shown to modulate alpha asymmetry. Thus, in the light of the previous literature and the current findings, we suggest that frontal alpha asymmetry along with emotional interference of response speed might be a feasible biomarker for the effects of neuromodulation on brain's affective circuitry in general.Copyright © 2017 Sun, Perakyla and Hartikainen.",0,,,

212,"We describe five patients with frontal lobe epilepsy who underwent electrocortical stimulation (ES) for language localization and language functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) prior to epilepsy surgery. Six months after surgery, three patients suffered from a drop of verbal fluency. In all of them, frontal areas with presurgical language fMRI activity were resected. Our results suggest that resection in regions of areas with presurgical fMRI activation is not without risk for a postsurgical loss of function, even when ES results were negative for language function in these areas. Using fMRI activations might be specifically helpful to plan the resection when ES delivered inconclusive results.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",5,,,
213,"Background: Post-hypoxic myoclonus (PHM) is a syndrome that occurs when a patient has suffered hypoxic brain injury. The myoclonus is usually multifocal and generalized, often stemming from both cortical and subcortical origins. In severe cases, pharmacological treatments with antiepileptic medications may not satisfactorily control the myoclonus. Method(s): We present a case of a 23-year-old male with chronic medication refractory PHM following a cardiopulmonary arrest related to an asthmatic attack who improved with bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS). We review the clinical features of PHM, as well as the preoperative and postoperative Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale scores and DBS programming parameters in this patient and compare them with the three other published PHM-DBS cases in the literature. Result(s): This patient experienced an alleviation of myoclonic jerks at rest and a 39% reduction in action myoclonus with improvement in both positive and negative myoclonus with bilateral GPi-DBS. High frequency stimulation (130 Hz) with amplitudes >2.5 V were needed for the therapeutic response. Discussion(s): We demonstrate a robust improvement in a medication refractory PHM patient with bilateral GPi-DBS, and suggest that it is a viable therapeutic option for debilitating post-hypoxic myoclonus.Copyright © 2017 Ramdhani et al.",1,,2.5,
214,"Objective: Evaluate the seizure-reduction response and safety of mesial temporal lobe (MTL) brain-responsive stimulation in adults with medically intractable partial-onset seizures of mesial temporal lobe origin. Method(s): Subjects with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) were identified from prospective clinical trials of a brain-responsive neurostimulator (RNS System, NeuroPace). The seizure reduction over years 2-6 postimplantation was calculated by assessing the seizure frequency compared to a preimplantation baseline. Safety was assessed based on reported adverse events. Result(s): There were 111 subjects with MTLE; 72% of subjects had bilateral MTL onsets and 28% had unilateral onsets. Subjects had one to four leads placed; only two leads could be connected to the device. Seventy-six subjects had depth leads only, 29 had both depth and strip leads, and 6 had only strip leads. The mean follow-up was 6.1 +/- (standard deviation) 2.2 years. The median percent seizure reduction was 70% (last observation carried forward). Twenty-nine percent of subjects experienced at least one seizure-free period of 6 months or longer, and 15% experienced at least one seizure-free period of 1 year or longer. There was no difference in seizure reduction in subjects with and without mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), bilateral MTL onsets, prior resection, prior intracranial monitoring, and prior vagus nerve stimulation. In addition, seizure reduction was not dependent on the location of depth leads relative to the hippocampus. The most frequent serious device-related adverse event was soft tissue implant-site infection (overall rate, including events categorized as device-related, uncertain, or not device-related: 0.03 per implant year, which is not greater than with other neurostimulation devices). Significance: Brain-responsive stimulation represents a safe and effective treatment option for patients with medically intractable epilepsy, including patients with unilateral or bilateral MTLE who are not candidates for temporal lobectomy or who have failed a prior MTL resection.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

215,"Background Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is considered a medical emergency in neurology and is related to high mortality. We report a successfully treated case of RSE using deep brain stimulation (DBS) at the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) in a 17-year-old woman. Results This patient developed RSE as a result of progressive seizure activity. RSE with generalized tonic-clonic seizures was noted 2 weeks before admission. Video electroencephalography monitoring showed continuous 3-Hz generalized spike-and-wave complexes with higher amplitude over bilateral frontal. Four weeks after RSE onset, bilateral DBS of the ATN was started. This treatment was immediately followed by the disappearance of tonic-clonic seizures and spike-and-wave complexes, suggesting resolution of the RSE. Significant clinical improvement was noted 1 week after DBS implantation. Conclusions DBS at the ATN significantly improved both the electroencephalography and clinical presentation in the patient with RSE. DBS at the ATN should be considered as a possible treatment choice once a patient develops RSE.Copyright © 2016 The Authors",1,,,
216,"Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) can be an alternative treatment option for intractable epilepsy patients. Since CM may be involved in widespread cortico-subcortical networks, identification of the cortical sub-networks specific to the target stimuli may provide further understanding on the underlying mechanisms of CM DBS. Several brain structures have distinguishing brain connections that may be related to the pivotal propagation and subsequent clinical effect of DBS. Method(s): To explore core structures and their connections relevant to CM DBS, we applied electroencephalogram (EEG) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to 10 medically intractable patients - three generalized epilepsy (GE) and seven multifocal epilepsy (MFE) patients unsuitable for resective surgery. Spatiotemporal activation pattern was mapped from scalp EEG by delivering low-frequency stimuli (5 Hz). Structural connections between the CM and the cortical activation spots were assessed using DTI. Result(s): We confirmed an average 72% seizure reduction after CM DBS and its clinical efficiency remained consistent during the observation period (mean 21 months). EEG data revealed sequential source propagation from the anterior cingulate, followed by the frontotemporal regions bilaterally. In addition, maximal activation was found in the left cingulate gyrus and the right medial frontal cortex during the right and left CM stimulation, respectively. From DTI data, we confirmed concrete structural connections between CM and those maximal activation spots identified from EEG data. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that the anterior cingulate can be a core cortical structure for the bilateral propagation of CM stimulation. Our DTI findings also indicate that the propagation of CM stimulation may rely upon integrity of structural connections between CM and these key cortical regions. Structures and their connections found in this study may be relevant in the interpretation of the clinical outcomes of CM DBS.Copyright © 2017 Kim et al.",10,,,
217,"Introduction Surgical resection of a lesion that correlates with seizure onset in patients with epilepsy can dramatically improve seizure burden and quality of life. For bilateral hippocampal lesions, bilateral resection comes with a risk of severe cognitive deficits. Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) devices offer a new modality to treat multifocal lesions in a reversible manner including bilateral hippocampal stimulation. We describe technical aspects of Nexframe-assisted placement of bilateral NeuroPace mesial temporal electrodes and case examples. Methods Retrospective chart review was performed for 4 patients who underwent bilateral mesial temporal RNS placement for medically intractable epilepsy. Operative techniques were assessed and modified. Ambulatory electrocorticographic recordings and a subanalysis of available data are summarized. Results Eight electrodes were placed in 4 patients, who were followed for up to 6 months. One out of 8 electrodes was revised due to vector error >3 mm; after surgical technique modification, all subsequent electrodes were reliably placed in a single pass with <2-mm vector error. Using patients' seizure diaries, seizure semiologies were correlated with ambulatory ECoG recording patterns and subanalyzed; 51.4% were left sided, 15% were right sided, and 33.6% were indeterminate. Conclusions We report herein the technical nuances of adapting Nexframe to hippocampal-based depth electrode RNS system placement. Our group has extensive experience with Nexframe for accurate and safe deep brain stimulation electrode placement. Our preliminary data with bitemporal RNS placement suggest similar accuracy and safety.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",4,,,
218,"Objective: We designed a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of hippocampal deep brain stimulation (Hip-DBS) in patients with refractory temporary lobe epilepsy (TLE). Method(s): Sixteen adult patients with refractory TLE were studied. Patient's workup included medical history, interictal and ictal electroencephalography (EEG), and high-resolution 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients were randomized on a 1:1 proportion to an active (stimulation on) or to a control (no stimulation) arm. After implantation, patients were allowed to recover for 1 month, which was followed by a 1-month titration (or sham) period. The 6-month blinded phase started immediately afterward. A postoperative MRI confirmed the electrode's position in all patients. All patients received bipolar continuous stimulation. Stimulus duration was 300 mus and frequency was 130 Hz; final intensity was 2 V. Patients were considered responders when they had at least 50% seizure frequency reduction. Result(s): All patients had focal impaired awareness seizures (FIAS, complex partial seizures), and 87% had focal aware seizures (FAS, simple partial seizures). Mean preoperative seizure frequency was 12.5 +/- 9.4 (mean +/- standard deviation) per month. MRI findings were normal in two patients, disclosed bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) in three, left MTS in five, and right MTS in six patients. An insertional effect could be noted in both control and active patients. In the active group (n = 8), four patients became seizure-free; seven of eight were considered responders and one was a nonresponder. There was a significant difference regarding FIAS frequency between the two groups from the first month of full stimulation (p < 0.001) until the end of the blinded phase (p < 0.001). This was also true for FAS, except for the third month of the blinded phase. Significance: Hip-DBS was effective in significantly reducing seizure frequency in patients with refractory TLE in the active group, as compared to the control group. Fifty-percent of the patients in the active group became seizure-free. The present study is the larger prospective, controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the effects of Hip-DBS published to date.Copyright Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2017 International League Against Epilepsy",16,,2.0,

The Stimulation of the Anterior Nucleus of the Thala-mus for Epilepsy (SANTE) trial demonstrated a reduction in seizures which was sustained in the long-term Methods: Eight patients (7 female, 1 male; age range 21-41 years) with medically refractory epilepsy unsuitable for or failed previous resection underwent bilateral DBS insertion from July 2012 until January 2014. Preoper-ative evaluation consisted of Liverpool seizure severity scale, Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE), neuropsychological evaluation, electroencephalogram (EEG), video EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),. Target selection was the anterior nucleus of the thalamus in 6 patients and centromedian nucleus of the thalamus in 2 patients. Mean follow up period was 36 months. Result(s): Seven patients had complex partial seizures with secondary gen-eralization and one patient had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Two patients had previous vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) insertion, 1 patient had a left temporal lobectomy and one further patient had previous limited left temporal lobe resection for dysembryonic neuroepithelial tumour (DNET) and VNS insertion. Out of 8 patients, 3 patients had more than 50% reduction in seizure fre-quency. 2 patients had around 50% reduction in seizure frequency and in 2 patients seizure frequency was unchanged. Postoperative neuropsychologi-cal outcomes were performed in 5 patients and this demonstrates improvement in mood and QOLIE in 3 patients and no significant change from baseline in 2 patients. Unfortunately in one patient, the seizure pattern changed to a more severe phenotype manifesting as drop attacks. This phenomenon has to our knowledge not been reported elsewhere. Eventually, this led to the DBS system being removed. However for the first 18 months, this patient experienced reduction in his attacks. Conclusion(s): This small series is consistent with the results of the SANTE trial with approximately two-thirds of the patients obtaining benefit and half of these, substantial benefit with DBS stimulation being an efficacious and safe treatment for patients with medically refractory partial and secondarily generalized epilepsy.",8,,,
220,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the application of electrical currents via depth electrodes to regulate neuronal activity. DBS has been shown as a productive intervention for seizure control in patients with drug-resistance. This case had both a failed response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and a temporal lobectomy. Method(s): This case details the evolution of epilepsy in a 29-year-old female with seizures since the age of around 10. The patient has been followed for 6 months to monitor the treatment effects. No medication changes were made post-procedure. Result(s): The patient experienced a seizure frequency of 2-5 events per month. The patient had a right temporal lobectomy at age 12, which led to only 3 years in remission. The events are complex partial seizures characterized by unresponsive staring, lip smacking, hand automatisms and confusion. The patient failed 7 AEDs. Intracranial recording showed the most frequent activity coming from the left anterior and posterior hippocampus. Two depth electrodes were implanted accordingly. Stimulation began in September 2016 and the patient has since had only 2 seizures. Conclusion(s): Deep brain stimulation provides extensive relief for this case of intractable epilepsy. The patient's level of awareness, mood, and quality of life all improved significantly in response to treatment.",1,,,
221,"Objectives: A controversy exist in interpretating the postoperative EEG driving response (DR) an indicator of electrode placement within the thalamic nucleus in the deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) for refractory epilepsy. Method(s): We retrospectively investigated the relation between postoperative EEG DR and the location of electrodes (n=11) in 6 patients who underwent ANT DBS for refractory epilepsy (Table 1). Result(s): A cerebral synchronizing, EEG DR (Fig.1) was observed in 10 electrodes, however, 9 of 11 electrodes were found to be located within ANT. Among the 2 electrodes missed ANT, DR was observed in one, misplaced electrode facing the anterior surface of ANT within the third ventricle (Fig. 2a). The other misplaced electrode without DR elicitation showed a DR after repositioning of the electrode (Fig. 2b). Conclusion(s): A diagnostic significance of DR as an indirect evidence of electrode within thalamic nuclei is limited. If DR is not elicicited, it should be regarded as a misplacement. Even if DR is elicited, it should not be interpreted as a sound indicator of proper electrode placement within the thalamus. Therefore, a sophisticated, postoperative imaging study is warranted in every case of ANT DBS. (Figure Presented).",6,,,
222,"Introduction: Epilepsy surgery is a valid option for patients with refractory epilepsy, which constitute approximately 30% of the total of cases. Epileptic syndromes without structural lesions or bilateral or multiple foci are candidates for non-resective techniques, among which Neuromodulation as one of the most modern forms of emerging treatment. Method(s): In our experience in palliative surgery of epilepsy through neuromodulation, two patients have been implanted. The electrodes was bilaterally placed in orthogonal transventricular direction towards the anterosuperior portion of the anterior thalamic nucleus. The first case was a 45-year-old man with a history of monoxide poisoning who evolved at 3 years with refractory generalized seizures. MRI showed bilateral temporomesial sclerosis. VEEG showed bitemporal discharges without lateralization. 8 bilateral deep electrodes were implanted with stereotactic guidance in wich a bitemporal origin was observed. Resective surgery was contraindicated and DBS was implanted. The second patient was a 21-year-old man, with a history of 8 years of epilepsy with falls and tonic clonic seizure several times per day. Pharmacological treatment obtained just only an initial improvement, without sustained control of seizures. It was studied by MRI, VEEG and PET, without being able to determine indications of laterality of the epileptogenic focus. Finally, SEEG was performed using 15 deep electrodes, which showed bifronto-temporal foci. Based on the results obtained DBS was indicated. Outcome(s): Both DBS system implanted has been switched on, achieving a significant reduction of the seizures in the medium and short term, respectively. Longer follow-up time is necessary to give definitive results. The patients tolerated very well the procedure without intraprocedural neither post-surgical complications. Conclusion(s): In view of the results obtained and the perspectives of our center, we plan to continue developing this type of treatment in an interdisciplinary way. In our experience, DBS of the anterior thalamus nucleus for refractory epilepsy is a safe form of treatment for the patient. The international literature demonstrated its effectiveness in the control of the amount of crisis and duration of the same, which projects us to develop this technique at the level of the worldwide reference groups.",2,,,
223,"Background: The effectiveness of ANT-DBS has been demonstrated by a randomized controlled (SANTE) trial. Originally, ANT was selected as a stimulation target based on its presumed role in seizure spread leading to impairment of consciousness and secondarily generalization. Unfortunately, no data is available at this moment guiding patient selection to ANT-DBS. Objective(s): In the present study we have analysed the effect of ANT-DBS on specific seizure types with emphasis on the impairment of consciousness. Method(s): Sixteen consecutive patients with ANT-DBS implanted in Tampere University Hospital with at least two years of follow-up were included in the study. The seizure diaries of patients were carefully evaluated for reliability based on previous video-EEG studies taking into account the patients' ability to remember and count seizures. The presence of caregivers and family members during the day/night was assessed to get a comprehensive understanding of the details of seizure reporting. Result(s): The dominant seizure type was seizures with impaired awareness (CPS) present in all patients, aware seizures (SPS) were present in 31% and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (SGTCS) in 63% of patients. The reduction of seizures can already be seen after the first 3 months of treatment with ANT-DBS (Figure 1). The most prominent change was seen in CPS seizures; from mean monthly baseline seizure count of 56 down to 22 seizures. When CPS were analyzed in terms of duration of disturbance of consciousness, the seizures with impaired awareness for more than 30 seconds decreased significantly more than very short CPS seizures. Discussion(s): This study demonstrates that the effect of ANT-DBS treatment in epilepsy is largest for the seizures with disturbance of consciousness, where it seems to decrease both the frequency and duration of these seizures. Furthermore, also tonic-clonic seizures decreased significantly. The effect was not dependent on the epilepsy type and there was no difference with regard to the seizure onset zone of the seizures. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that patients with predominantly seizures with long lasting disturbance in consciousness may be optimal candidates for this form of therapy.

224,"Objectives: To investigate the clinical outcome and location of active contacts in chronic centromedian nucleus (CM) deep brain stimulation (DBS) for refractory epilepsy. Method(s): The outcome of CM stimulation was evaluated with percent (%) seizure reduction compared to the baseline three months. To determine the location of active contacts, 27 leads in 14 patients with refractory epilepsy were studied. An analysis was conducted to determine whether any coordinates of the center of the active contacts predicted percent seizure reduction (Fig. 1). Result(s): With an average follow-up of 18.2 +/- 5.6 months, the mean percent seizure reduction (n=14) was 68 +/- 22.4% (25-100%). Eleven of 14 patients (78.6%) could achieve >50% improvement in the frequency of seizure. Specifically, all four patients (100%) with generalized epilepsy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) and seven out of 10 patients (70%) with multilobar epilepsy showed >50% reduction in seizure frequency (Fig. 2). The mean coordinates of center of the active contact were located in the superior part of anterior ventrolateral CM. The calculated coordinates of laterality from midline (x), anterior-posterior (y) and height (z) from posterior commissure (PC) did not correlate with seizure outcome measured by percent seizure reduction. However, the locations of active contacts used during chronic CM stimulation in multilobar epilepsy were identified more dorsal to those used in generalized epilepsy (Fig. 3). Conclusion(s): Chronic CM stimulation is a safe and effective means in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. (Figure Presented).",14,,,
225,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of thalamus (ANT) is an emerging form of adjunctive therapy in focal refractory epilepsy. ANT is encapsulated by incomplete white matter layers and located immediately adjacent to cerebrospinal fluid space which may be reflected to impedance values of implanted DBS leads. Objective(s): In the present study we asked whether therapeutic impedance values correlate with the location of a given contact and/or patient outcomes. Patients and Methods: A total of 16 patients with chronic ANT-DBS for refractory epilepsy comprising 57 contacts and 604 impedance measurements recorded on regular outpatient clinic visits were studied. Contact locations were analyzed in detail using postoperative CT - 3T MRI STIR fusion images previously shown to demonstrate anatomical boundaries of ANT. Result(s): The contacts in leads implanted using transventricular trajectory (n=21) which were located immediately below the CSF surface showed overall lower and slightly decreasing impedances over time compared to higher and more stable impedances in contacts with deeper parenchymal location implanted either transventricularly (n=3) or extraventricularly (n=6). Impedance values in contacts in ANT (n=35) were significantly lower compared to the outside-ANT (n=19) location (821 +/- 170 OMEGA vs. 1070 +/- 146 OMEGA; p<0,001) or location at the inferior, lateral and posterior border of ANT (998 +/- 102 OMEGA; p<0,001, figure 1A). We found a significant correlation between therapeutic impedance and the distance of contact from CSF surface in leads implanted using transventricular trajectory (r=0.75; R2=0.56, figure 1B). We also found that therapy impedance values were significantly lower (mean 748 +/- 176 OMEGA) in contacts with favorable therapy response (n=25) compared to non-responding contacts (n=29) (mean 988 +/- 200 OMEGA; p<0,001; independent samples t-test, Figure 1C). Finally, we observed a significant correlation between impedance (left and right side averaged) and the reduction of total number of seizures (r=0.60; R2=0.36, Figure 1D). Conclusion(s): Therapeutic impedance values may be used to select active contact with most optimal location at ANT (between CSF and deeper thalamic structures) with most probable therapeutic effect.

226,"The aim of this study was to compare the results of chronic stimulation and bilateral radiofrequency lesions of anterior thalamic nuclei in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The selection of the anterior nucleus of thalamus (ANT) as a potential target for treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy was based on data suggesting its crucial role in seizure propagation. This article describes the results of bilateral ANT lesions and chronic stimulation in 31 patients with refractory epilepsy. 19 patients underwent the stereotactic radiofrequency lesions of ANT (I group) and 12 have the ANT-DBS (II group). Targeting was based on stereotactic atlas information with correction of the final coordinates according to location of clearly visible structures and microelectrode recording. Both groups were quite similar in age, gender, seizures frequency and duration of disease. The median x, y, and z coordinates of ANT were found to be 2.9, 5, and 11 mm anterior, lateral, and superior to the midcommissural point, respectively. Mean seizures reduction reached 80,3% in I group with 2 non-responders and 91,2% in II group. 3 patients form I group and 4 patients from II group are seizure-free now. The morbidity rate was low in both groups. The stereotactic lesion and chronic stimulation of ANT both effective for seizure control in epilepsy originated from frontal and temporal lobes. Secondary generalized seizures more demonstrated more sensitivity to ANT lesions and stimulation comparatively to simple partial seizures. Microelectrode recording allows identifying the physiological borders of ANT and improves the surgical outcomes.",31,,,
227,"Objective: To test whether immature uncrossed corticospinal projections are maintained in the epileptogenic hemisphere in focal cortical childhood epilepsy. Background(s): While corticospinal connections are bilateral at birth, a predominantly contralateral corticospinal pattern develops by the toddler years. Early life acquired unilateral injury can alter the normal development of laterality such that uncrossed corticospinal connections persist in the uninjured hemisphere. Here, we evaluate whether focal epilepsy is also associated with abnormal patterns of laterality in the motor system. Design/Methods: Children with intractable focal epilepsy were enrolled and MRI-guided nTMS was applied with a figure-of-eight coil as part of the presurgical evaluation. Data were analyzed if subjects had: (1) focal, unilateral seizures, (2) successful nTMS mapping of the tibialis anterior (TA), (3) no lesion over M1 or corticospinal tract evident on MRI, and (4) preserved ipsilateral TA representation in only one hemisphere. Result(s): Of 117 patients (10mo-23y) who had nTMS for presurgical planning, 16 patients (13.2y +/-5.2) met the predefined criteria for the analysis, 15 of 16 patients (94%) with focal epilepsy and a unilaterally-preserved ipsilateral TA representation had the preserved ipsilateral corticospinal signal in the epileptic hemisphere (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): We demonstrate preserved uncrossed corticospinal connections in the affected hemisphere of children with focal epilepsy. In such patients this pathologically-preserved immature motor lateralization suggests an extension of the critical period for motor development, perhaps resulting from aberrant use-dependent plasticity in local cortical circuits or from use-dependent myelination of the ipsilateral corticospinal tracts. We hypothesize that abnormal development of laterality associated with pediatric epilepsy likely extends beyond the motor system, causing cortical crowding of cortical function and contributing to cognitive dysfunction in epilepsy.",117,,,
228,"Vagus nerve stimulation is an established therapy for refractory epilepsy patients with long-term efficacy reaching 75% seizure frequency decrease. The drawbacks of the therapy are the inability to predict response in individual patients, the lack of knowledge on optimal stimulation parameters and the 1/3 of patients who are non-responsive to the therapy. Elucidation of the mechanism of action may help to identify biomarkers for response, lead to the application of rationally chosen stimulation parameters and eventually an increase in outcome. Several lines of evidence support VNS-induced activation of the vagus nerve - locus coeruleus - norepinephrenic (VN-LC-NE) system as the key mechanism in its seizure-reducing effect. The level of VNS-induced NE release may be predictive of the seizure-suppressing effect, whereas a lack of NE increase following VNS could be indicative of non-response. Non-invasive indirect measures of NE level changes in the brain such as P3 recordings are currently being investigated as biomarkers for response prediction. The heart-brain connection, of which the vagus nerve is considered to represent the anatomical correlate, is a second line of research that may aid the search for response predictors. Stimulation of a major autonomic structure may be particularly suited to affect seizures that involve cortical areas that are implicated in the autonomic nervous system. The presence of impaired heart rate variability in epilepsy patients could be reflective of an autonomic imbalance that is susceptible to modulation with VNS. Both hypotheses imply that the presence of ictal heart rate changes in epilepsy patients may be predictive of VNS response. The measurement of cortical excitability by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) showed that acute VNS produced a selective and pronounced increase in intracortical inhibition and found a correlation between optimal clinical outcome and VNS-induced cortical modulation. Combined strategies of invasive and non-invasive neurostimulation may be useful in predicting outcome.",0,,,
229,"In medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the hippocampus plays a crucial role in the ictal onset, as has been demonstrated by various (invasive) electrophysiological and other studies in humans. This region often shows specific initial electroencephalographic epileptic form discharges. Significant seizure reductions observed after selective amygdalohippo-campectomy are in line with this presumed key function of the hippocampus in MTLE. Velasco et al. were the first to use diagnostic depth electrodes in humans to deliver electrical pulses to medial temporal lobe structures for 2-3 weeks prior to resective surgery. A chronic pilot trial in 2002 confirmed these preliminary findings, with 50-95% seizure reduction in three patients after 3-6 months of high-frequency hippocampal stimulation and after 6-10 years of continuation of this open-label trial 3/11 patients are now seizurefree for >3 years, 3/11 achieved a > 90% seizure reduction and 3/11 responded moderately with a 40-70% seizure reduction. In some of the patients (3/5) with unilateral MTLE maximum seizure frequency reduction was only achieved after initiation of bilateral hippocampal stimulation. Comparable results were found in two other open-label trials with longterm follow-up. In two small RCTs seizure reduction reached statistical significance but seizure reduction in these RCTs was less clear compared to the results of open-label trials. Recent studies by Cukiert et al, Velasco et al. and Boex and colleagues confirmed the seizure reduction potential of hippocampal DBS in various subpopulations. With appropriate stimulation parameter settings neither uni- nor bilateral hippocampal stimulation resulted in neuropsychological deterioration and has actually been associated with enhanced emotional well-being. Current experimental animal research on the underlying mechanism(s) of action of hippocampal DBS aims at an optimization of the stimulation protocol and increased seizure reduction rates. While resective surgery remains the treatment of choice for pharmacologically refractory MTLE patients, hippocampal DBS seems a valuable alternative for those patients who are unsuitable surgical candidates (independent bitemporal foci, high risk of memory decline,) or who are reluctant to undergo resective brain surgery.",3,,,
230,"Objectives (A) To develop a TMS-EEG stimulation and data analysis protocol in genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). (B) To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of TMS-EEG in GGE. Methods Pilot experiments resulted in the development and optimization of a paired-pulse TMS-EEG protocol at rest, during hyperventilation (HV), and post-HV combined with multi-level data analysis. This protocol was applied in 11 controls (C) and 25 GGE patients (P), further dichotomized into responders to antiepileptic drugs (R, n = 13) and non-responders (n-R, n = 12).Features (n = 57) extracted from TMS-EEG responses after multi-level analysis were given to a feature selection scheme and a Bayesian classifier, and the accuracy of assigning participants into the classes P-C and R-nR was computed. Results On the basis of the optimal feature subset, the cross-validated accuracy of TMS-EEG for the classification P-C was 0.86 at rest, 0.81 during HV and 0.92 at post-HV, whereas for R-nR the corresponding figures are 0.80, 0.78 and 0.65, respectively. Applying a fusion approach on all conditions resulted in an accuracy of 0.84 for the classification P-C and 0.76 for the classification R-nR. Conclusion TMS-EEG can be used for diagnostic purposes and for assessing the response to antiepileptic drugs.

231,"For the one-third of patients with epilepsy whose seizures are refractory to medications and who are not surgical or dietary therapy candidates, alternative therapies such as neurostimulation provide a promising alternative. Neurostimulation techniques include vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation (particularly stimulation of the anterior thalamus), and responsive neurostimulation.

232,"Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of intracranial stimulation to treat refractory epilepsy in children. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of a pilot study on all 8 children who had intracranial electrical stimulation for the investigation and treatment of refractory epilepsy at King's College Hospital between 2014 and 2015. Five children (one with temporal lobe epilepsy and four with frontal lobe epilepsy) had subacute cortical stimulation (SCS) for a period of 20-161 h during intracranial video-telemetry. Efficacy of stimulation was evaluated by counting interictal discharges and seizures. Two children had thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the centromedian nucleus (one with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, one with presumed symptomatic generalized epilepsy), and one child on the anterior nucleus (right fronto-temporal epilepsy). The incidence of interictal discharges was evaluated visually and quantified automatically. Results Among the three children with DBS, two had >60% improvement in seizure frequency and severity and one had no improvement. Among the five children with SCS, four showed improvement in seizure frequency (>50%) and one chid did not show improvement. Procedures were well tolerated by children. Conclusion Cortical and thalamic stimulation appear to be effective and well tolerated in children with refractory epilepsy. SCS can be used to identify the focus and predict the effects of resective surgery or chronic cortical stimulation.

233,"Neurostimulation can be an alternative treatment for medically intractable epilepsy, especially when the resective surgery could not be performed. The author reported a case of 19-year-old, right-handed male patient who had a history of intractable epilepsy for 11 years after post viral encephalitis associated with status epilepticus. Following the failure of antiepileptic medications and then resective surgery, anterior thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) was performed. Indirect targeting of anterior thalamic nuclei could not be used because of asymmetric brain shift from prior multilobar resections. Direct targeting of anterior thalamic nuclei from MRI T1 sequence, Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequence combined neurophysiological mapping by microelectrode recording were used as a technique for implantation of DBS electrodes. The stimulation was turned on with 145 Hz, pulse width 90 microseconds, 5 volts with cycling mode 1 minute ""on"" and 5 minutes ""0ff"". The antiepileptic medications continued the same as pre-operative state. Sixty percent seizure reduction was achieved in 24 months after surgery. There were no side effects of DBS during the follow-up period. Anterior thalamic DBS can be performed safely with satisfactory seizure outcomes. Direct targeting of anterior thalamic nuclei combination with microelectrode recording can be very helpful, especially when asymmetric basal ganglion structures were detected.Copyright © 2016, Medical Association of Thailand.

234,"Objectives: To investigate the clinical outcome of patients treated with chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the centromedian nucleus (CM) for refractory epilepsy and to determine the location of active contacts. Method(s): The outcome of CM stimulation was evaluated as percent seizure reduction compared to the baseline 3 months. To establish the location of active contacts, 27 leads were studied in 14 patients with refractory epilepsy. An analysis was conducted to reveal whether any coordinates of the center of the active contacts predicted percent seizure reduction. Result(s): With an average follow-up of 18.2 +/- 5.6 months, the mean percent seizure reduction (n = 14) was 68 +/- 22.4% (25-100%). Eleven of the 14 patients (78.6%) achieved >50% improvement in seizure frequency. Specifically, all 4 patients (100%) with generalized epilepsy (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) and 7 of 10 patients (70%) with multilobar epilepsy showed >50% reduction in seizure frequency. The mean coordinates of the center of the active contact were located in the superior part of the anterior ventrolateral CM. The calculated coordinates of laterality from midline (x), anterior-posterior (y) and height (z) from the posterior commissure did not correlate with seizure outcome measured by percent seizure reduction. However, the locations of active contacts used during chronic CM stimulation in multilobar epilepsy were identified more dorsal to those used in generalized epilepsy. Conclusion(s): Chronic CM stimulation is a safe and effective means in the treatment of refractory epilepsy.Copyright © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.",14,,,
235,"Objective: Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with an H-1 coil was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in adults. Studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of deep TMS in adolescent TRD are lacking. The purpose of this brief report is to provide a case history of an adolescent enrolled in an investigational deep TMS protocol. Method(s): A case history is described of the first participant of a sham-controlled clinical trial who had a seizure in the course of deep TMS with parameter settings extrapolated from the adult studies that led to US FDA approval (H-1 coil, 120% target stimulation intensity, 18 Hz, 55 trains of 2-second duration, total 1980 pulses). Result(s): The participant was a 17-year-old unmedicated female, with no significant medical history and no history of seizures or of drug or alcohol use. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed no structural abnormalities. She initially received sham, which was well tolerated. During active treatment sessions, titration began at 85% of motor threshold (MT) and increased by 5% per day. Her weekly MT measurements were stable. On her first day of 120% MT (8th active treatment), during the 48th train, the participant had a generalized, tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 90 seconds and resolved spontaneously. She had an emergency medicine evaluation and was discharged home without anticonvulsant medications. There were no further seizures reported at a 6-month follow-up. Conclusion(s): We report a deep TMS-induced generalized tonic-clonic seizure in an adolescent with TRD participating in a clinical trial. Given the demonstrated benefits of deep TMS for adult TRD, research investigating its use in adolescents with TRD is an important area. However, in light of this experience, additional precautions for adolescents should be considered. We propose that further dose-finding investigations are needed to refine adolescent-specific parameters that may be safe and effective for treating adolescents with TRD with deep TMS.Copyright © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",0,,,
236,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus) (ANT) has been suggested as a treatment option in refractory epilepsy. The targeting of ANT is especially challenging due to its poor visualization in commonly used MRI sequences, lack of easily observable symptom relief during surgery and high degree of anatomical variation between individuals. Objective(s): To study whether intraoperative microelectrode recording (MER), a method widely used in movement disorder surgery, provides clinically relevant information during the ANT-DBS implantation procedure. Method(s): A total of 186 MER samples from 5 patients and 10 thalami obtained from ANT-DBS surgery for refractory epilepsy were analyzed with respect to the signal characteristics and location in 3-tesla (3T) MRI STIR (short T1 inversion recovery) images. The location of each MER sample was calculated relative to visible borders of the ANT after correction of the sample locations according to the position of the final DBS electrode in postoperative CT-MRI fusion images. Result(s): We found that the lateral aspect of the ANT lacked spiking activity consistent with the presence of white matter. The spike frequency in samples correlating with location at the ANT showed significantly lower spike frequency compared to samples correlating with location at the ventral anterior nucleus (median 3.0 and 7.0 spikes/2 s; p < 0.05), but spike bursts were morphologically similar in appearance. Trajectories entering the dorsomedial nucleus according to 3T MRI STIR images showed a yet different firing pattern with more low-amplitude regular activity. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that MER provides clinically relevant information during implantation surgery by demonstrating both nucleus-specific neuronal firing patterns and white matter laminae between different nuclear groups.Copyright © 2016 S.

237,"Objectives: Interpreting the postoperative electroencephalographic (EEG) driving response (DR) as an indicator of electrode placement within the thalamic nucleus in deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) for refractory epilepsy is controversial. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively investigated the relationship between postoperative EEG DR and the location of 11 electrodes in 6 patients who underwent ANT DBS for refractory epilepsy. Result(s): Cerebral synchronizing EEG DR was observed in 10 electrodes. However, 9 of the 11 electrodes were located within the ANT. For the 2 electrodes that missed the ANT, DR was observed in 1 misplaced electrode facing the anterior surface of the ANT within the third ventricle. The other misplaced electrode without DR elicitation showed a DR after electrode repositioning. Conclusion(s): The diagnostic significance of DR as indirect evidence of electrodes being within thalamic nuclei is limited. If DR is not elicited, it should be regarded as a misplacement. Even if DR is elicited, it may not be interpreted as a sound indicator of proper electrode placement within the thalamus. A sophisticated, postoperative imaging study is warranted in every case of ANT DBS.Copyright © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.",6,,,
238,"Objective: In this study we analyzed the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on sleep and on the self-perceived quality of life in epileptic patients. Method(s): A total of 24 male patients diagnosed with focal epilepsy were included in the study. Pharmacological treatment with levetiracetam was standardized at 2 g daily. Before TMS onset, all-night polysomnographic recording (PSG) was performed, and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) was administered. Thereafter, patients underwent low-frequency repetitive TMS (1000 pulses/1 Hz) daily for 10 days. After the end of the treatment, a second polysomnographic study was performed, and the QOLIE-31 questionnaire was administered again. Result(s): TMS induced a significant increase in sleep efficiency and in total sleep time, along with a decrease in sleep latency and the number of awakenings. In addition, the number of interictal discharges during sleep decreased significantly. Concerning the QOLIE-31 scale values, the patients showed great improvement in the self-perceived quality of life. Conclusion(s): The present results indicate that TMS may mediate therapeutic effects in the treatment of patients with focal epilepsy, and that TMS treatment is accompanied by improvement of sleep patterns as well as improvement in self-perceived quality of life. However, a study that includes a control group undergoing sham stimulation is needed to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",24,,,
239,"Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of thalamus (ANT) is an evolving treatment option in refractory focal epilepsy. Due to poor visualization of ANT in traditional MRI sequences used for movement disorder surgery, targeting of ANT is mainly based on stereotactic atlas information. Sophisticated 3T MRI methods enable visualization of ANT, but 1.5T MRI is still preferred or more readily available in a large number of centers performing DBS. Objective(s): In the present study, we sought to determine whether ANT could be adequately visualized at 1.5T MRI pre- and postoperatively using imaging techniques similar to the ones visualizing ANT in 3T MRI. A total of 15 MRI examinations with short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and T1-weighted magnetization prepared gradient echo (MPRAGE) images were performed to visualize ANT in nonepileptic subjects (n = 2), patients with vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) (n = 3), stereotactic MRI (n = 3), patients with ANT-DBS (n = 7). Result(s): ANT was distinctly visualized in STIR and T1-weighted MPRAGE images in patients without implanted stimulators, with Leksell stereotactic frame and with fully implanted VNS. Postoperative 1.5T MRI was able to demonstrate some of the anatomical landmarks around ANT enabling assessment of electrode contact locations. Conclusion(s): The visualization of ANT is possible in preoperative 1.5T MRI enabling direct targeting of ANT all examined situations. The use of indirect targeting and its inherent potential for lead misplacement due to anatomical variation may be avoided using these MRI methods. Furthermore, postoperative MRI with STIR and T1-weighted MPRAGE images enable detailed postoperative assessment of contact locations.Copyright © 2016 International Neuromodulation Society",0,,,
240,"Introduction: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established non-invasive neurostimulation technique that is able to induce neuromodulatory effects outlasting the duration of the stimulation train. The cortical excitability disturbance in epilepsy provides a rationale for investigating the efficacy of low-frequency rTMS as a treatment for epilepsy patients. Sofar clinical trials in epilepsy patients have shown conflicting results ranging from ineffective to very effective. Areas covered: This manuscript provides an overview of the performed studies, retrieved from a PubMed search, and a critical appraisal of their results. A number of conclusions are drawn and potential optimization strategies are discussed. Expert commentary: Although the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS in refractory epilepsy has not yet been established, the non-invasiveness of the technique warrants further investigation of rTMS as a treatment for epilepsy.Copyright © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0,,,
241,"For patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy in whom surgical resection of the epileptogenic focus fails or was not feasible in the first place, there were few therapeutic options. Increasingly, neurostimulation provides an alternative treatment strategy for these patients. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is well established. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and cortical responsive stimulation (CRS) are newer neurostimulation therapies with recently published long-Term efficacy and safety data. In this literature review, we introduce these therapies to a non-specialist audience. Furthermore, we compare and contrast long-Term (5-year) outcomes of newer neurostimulation techniques with the more established VNS. A search to identify all studies reporting long-Term efficacy (>5a ..years) of VNS, CRS and DBS in patients with refractory focal/partial epilepsy was conducted using PubMed and Cochrane databases. The outcomes compared were responder rate, percentage seizure frequency reduction, seizure freedom, adverse events, neuropsychological outcome and quality of life. We identified 1 study for DBS, 1 study for CRS and 4 studies for VNS. All neurostimulation technologies showed long-Term efficacy, with progressively better seizure control over time. Sustained improvement in quality of life measures was demonstrated in all modalities. Intracranial neurostimulation had a greater side effect profile compared with extracranial stimulation, though all forms of stimulation are safe. Methodological differences between the studies mean that direct comparisons are not straightforward. We have synthesised the findings of this review into a pragmatic decision tree, to guide the further management of the individual patient with pharmacoresistant focal-onset epilepsy.Copyright © 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",0,,,
242,Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of chronic continuous hippocampal deep brain stimulation (DBS) in nonlesional refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods Three adult patients with medically intractable epilepsy treated with hippocampal DBS were studied. Two patients underwent invasive recordings with depth stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes to localize ictal onset zone prior to implantation of DBS electrodes. All the patients with no lesion in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan received bilateral implantation of DBS electrodes. Chronic continuous high-frequency hippocampal stimulation was applied during treatment. The number of seizures in each patient before and after stimulation was compared. Results Long-term hippocampal stimulation produced a median reduction in seizure frequency of 93%. Two out of these patients received unilateral activation of the electrodes and experienced a 95% and 92% reduction in seizure frequency after hippocampal DBS respectively. The last patient had bilateral electrode activation and had a seizure-frequency reduction of 91%. None of the patients had neuropsychological deterioration and showed side effects. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures disappeared completely after hippocampal DBS. Conclusions Chronic continuous hippocampal DBS demonstrated a potential efficiency and safety in nonlesional refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and might represent an effective therapeutic option for these patients.Copyright © 2016 British Epilepsy Association.

243,"BACKGROUND: Anterior nucleus (AN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a palliative treatment for medically refractory epilepsy. The long-term efficacy and the optimal target localization for AN DBS are not well understood. OBJECTIVE(S): To analyze the long-term efficacy of AN DBS and its predictors. METHOD(S): We performed a retrospective review of 16 patients who underwent AN DBS. We selected only patients with reliable seizure frequency data and at least a 1-year follow-up. We studied the duration of the seizure reduction after DBS insertion and before stimulation (the insertional effect) and its association with long-term outcome. We modeled the volume of activation using the active contacts, stimulation parameters, and postoperative imaging. The overlap of this volume was plotted in Montreal Neurological Institute 152 space in 7 patients with significant clinical efficacy. RESULT(S): Nine patients reported a decrease in seizure frequency immediately after electrode insertion (insertional or microthalamotomy effect). The duration of insertional effect varied from 2 to 4 months. However, 1 patient had a long-term insertional effect of 36 months. Altogether, 11 patients reported >50% decrease in seizure frequency with long-term stimulation. The most common pattern of seizure control was immediate and sustained stimulation benefit (n 8). In patients with long-term stimulation benefit, the efficacious target was localized in the anteroventral AN in close proximity to the mammillothalamic tract. CONCLUSION(S): AN DBS is efficacious in the control of seizure frequency in selected patients. An insertional effect is commonly observed (56%). The most efficacious site of stimulation appears to be the anteroventral AN.Copyright © 2015 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",16,,,
244,"Objective The effect of electrical stimulation on brain glutamate release in humans is unknown. Glutamate is elevated at baseline in the epileptogenic hippocampus of patients with refractory epilepsy, and increases during spontaneous seizures. We examined the effect of 50 Hz stimulation on glutamate release and its relationship to interictal levels in the hippocampus of patients with epilepsy. In addition, we measured basal and stimulated glutamate levels in a subset of these patients where stimulation elicited a seizure. Methods Subjects (n = 10) were patients with medically refractory epilepsy who were undergoing intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Electrical stimulation (50 Hz) was delivered through implanted hippocampal electrodes (n = 11), and microdialysate samples were collected every 2 min. Basal glutamate, changes in glutamate efflux with stimulation, and the relationships between peak stimulation-associated glutamate concentrations, basal zero-flow levels, and stimulated seizures were examined. Results Stimulation of epileptic hippocampi in patients with refractory epilepsy caused increases in glutamate efflux (p = 0.005, n = 10), and 4 of ten patients experienced brief stimulated seizures. Stimulation-induced increases in glutamate were not observed during the evoked seizures, but rather were related to the elevation in interictal basal glutamate (R2 = 0.81, p = 0.001). The evoked-seizure group had lower basal glutamate levels than the no-seizure group (p = 0.04), with no stimulation-induced change in glutamate efflux (p = 0.47, n = 4). Conversely, increased glutamate was observed following stimulation in the no-seizure group (p = 0.005, n = 7). Subjects with an atrophic hippocampus had higher basal glutamate levels (p = 0.03, n = 7) and higher stimulation-induced glutamate efflux. Significance Electrical stimulation of the epileptic hippocampus either increased extracellular glutamate efflux or induced seizures. The magnitude of stimulated glutamate increase was related to elevation in basal interictal glutamate, suggesting a common mechanism, possibly impaired glutamate metabolism. Divergent mechanisms may exist for seizure induction and increased glutamate in patients with epilepsy. These data highlight the potential risk of 50 Hz stimulation in patients with epilepsy.Copyright © 2016 International League Against Epilepsy.",10,,,
245,"Summary Objective Determine the efficacy and side effects of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat refractory neocortical epilepsy and study differences in effect between a figure-8 and round coil type. Methods This single-center randomized sham-controlled crossover trial (NCT01745952 on ClinicalTrials.gov) included 11 patients with well-defined focal epilepsy. rTMS (0.5 Hz) was targeted to the focus during three treatment conditions consisting of 1,500 stimulations/day for 10 weekdays at 90% of resting motor threshold (rMT) followed by a 10-week observation period. Patients were randomized for the order in which the figure-8, round, and sham coil were used. Outcome assessors and patients were blinded to the type of coil used. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of seizure reduction after active rTMS treatment. Other outcome measures were responder rate, quality of life, and side effects. Results There was no difference between a figure-8 and round coil. None of the patients achieved an overall 50% seizure reduction. One patient responded during 1 month after treatment with either active coil, followed by a significant increase in seizure frequency. Another patient had a fourfold increase in seizure frequency during rTMS treatment. Significance This study provides evidence that rTMS is on average not effective for reducing seizure frequency. No difference in effectiveness between the different coil types was observed. It can, however, exacerbate seizures during treatment and lead to a rebound in seizure frequency after an initial reduction.Copyright © 2015 International League Against Epilepsy.",11,,,
246,"Background Deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) is an emerging therapy for refractory focal epilepsy. However, the most optimal target for stimulation has not been unambiguously described. Objective In the present study, we investigated the correlation between the stimulation site and outcome in order to define the optimal target for deep brain stimulation in refractory epilepsy. Methods The locations of 62 contacts used in 30 treatment attempts in 15 prospectively followed patients during a 5 year period were assessed. Treatment attempts were classified into responding and non-responding trials using seizure reduction and side effect profile as criteria. The locations of active contacts were calculated with respect to mid-commissural point and visible borders of ANT in 3T MRI (ANT-normalized coordinate system) aiming to minimize the confounding effect of individual variation in the location and size of the ANT. Results Contacts in successful treatment trials were located significantly more anterior and superior both in AC-PC and ANT-normalized coordinate systems. Favourable outcome was observed at 3T MRI based location of ANT but not at location predicted by Schaltenbrandt atlas sagittal data. Contacts used in successful trials were at anterior aspect of the ANT complex evidenced by the ANT-normalized coordinate system. Conclusion The anti-epileptic effect of anterior thalamic DBS may be dependent on stimulation site especially in the anterior to posterior axis. Extensive anatomical variation confounds severely the targeting of ANT. Therefore, direct visualization of the desired target for stimulation is essential for favourable outcome in refractory epilepsy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",15,,,

QPSs at interpulse intervals (IPIs) of 5, 30, 50, 100, 500 and 1250 ms were applied over the left primary motor cortex (M1) for 30 min. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of N20 to P25 (N20-P25) and P25 to N33 (P25-N33) components were measured at the left somatosensory cortex. Result(s): In healthy participants, the P25-N33 was bidirectionally modulated by QPS over M1, following the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) theory. The N20-P25 was not affected by any QPSs. In ME patients, the giant P25-N33 was potentiated after any QPSs. Furthermore, the N20-P25 was also potentiated after QPS at IPIs of 5, 30, 50 100 or 500 ms. Conclusion(s): In ME patients, the cascade for long-term depression-like effects may be impaired. Significance: The giant SEP was furthermore enhanced by QPS.Copyright © 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",6,,,
248,"Objectives: Intracranial direct electrical stimulation (iDES) uses different parameters for mapping the epileptogenic and functional areas in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We aim at finding the common factor driving the electrographic responses to various iDES protocols reported in the literature. Method(s): We recorded early responses to single-pulse iDES in 11 subjects undergoing stereoelectroencephalographic presurgical evaluation. We systematically explored the role of several pulse parameters in evoking responses: monophasic versus biphasic pulses, current intensity, and pulse duration. We performed a correlation and regression analysis between responses to different protocols by amplitude, duration, and charge per phase. Result(s): Regression analysis revealed that the responses were similar for the same charge per phase, regardless of their pulse duration and amplitude. Over eighty percent (82.8%) of the responses to variable pulse duration biphasic stimulation and between 58.6% and 81.9% of the responses to monophasic stimulation, depending on pulse polarity, were correlated to the responses evoked by the variable amplitude biphasic protocol, when expressing stimulus strength in terms of charge per phase. Conclusion(s): Regardless of the combination of different stimulation currents, it is the underlying charge per phase parameter that determines the magnitude of the responses to single-pulse electrical stimulation. Significance: Our results provide a unifying method for comparing iDES protocols.Copyright © 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",11,,,
249,"Epilepsy affects 50 million people worldwide and about 30% of these patients will not be adequately controlled with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) alone. For patients where resective surgery is not indicated, deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be an effective alternative. The majority of available literature targets the thalamic nuclei (anterior; centromedian), subthalamic nucleus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Here, we review patient outcomes and adverse events related to DBS to these various targets. Data show DBS may be a safe and effective treatment option for refractory epilepsy.Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",0,,,
250,"Neurostimulation is a treatment modality in which electrical pulses are administered to nerve tissue in order to manipulate a pathological substrate and to achieve a symptomatic or even curative therapeutic effect. In human epilepsy, a substantial number of patients either lack good seizure control with pharmacological or surgical treatment, or they experience major adverse effects (or both). Therefore, neurostimulation-based treatments have gained considerable interest the last 10-15 years. Electrical stimulation of the tenth cranial nerve or vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an extracranial form of neurostimulation that was developed in the 1980s and is currently routinely and worldwide available for the management of human epilepsy. VNS is indicated in patients with refractory epilepsy who are unsuitable candidates for epilepsy surgery or who have had insufficient benefit from such a treatment. VNS influences crucial brainstem and intracranial structures including the nucleus of the solitary tract, the locus coeruleus, the thalamus, and limbic structures. The precise mechanism of action (MOA) by which VNS exerts its antiepileptic effect is still unknown. The current consensus on efficacy is that one third of patients have a considerable improvement in seizure control with a reduction in seizure frequency of at least 50%, one third of patients experience a worthwhile reduction in seizure frequency between 30% and 50%, and the remaining one third of patients experience little or no effect. Increased insight into the MOA may help to identify responders and increase clinical efficacy. Also, from a veterinary point of view, research towards neurostimulatory treatments for refractory canine epilepsy is needed. Only one study evaluated the efficacy and safety of VNS in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy and the results seemed promising. We examined the MOA of VNS in healthy Beagle dogs and demonstrated changes in cerebral perfusion using mu-SPECT and increases in CSF norepinephrine concentrations induced by VNS.",0,,,
251,"Background: The GNAO1 gene encodes an alpha subunit of the G-proteins, a large family of signal-transducing nucleotides. Recently de novo heterozygous GNAO1 mutations have been identified in 4 patients with infantile onset epileptic encephalopathies (1), and in 2 siblings with a severe chorea/ athetosis presenting in early childhood (2). Case Report: JM is a 13 year old girl. She presented at 6 months of age with generalised hypotonia. She began walking aged 3.5, with poor balance. She never developed any speech, but had apparently preserved cognition. Epileptic seizures started at aged 10 years. She only has generalised convulsive seizures, occurring typically once every 3 days. From the age of 11 years she developed a progressive paroxysmal movement disorder, which initially presented with dyskinetic tongue movements. Episodes of dyskinesia, affecting all 4 limbs and her head, became progressively more debilitating. These were precipitated by physical activity, viral infections, and various medications. Extensive genetic and metabolic investigations were unrevealing until, through the DDD study, a heterozygous de novo GNAO1 mutation was identified in 2014. In 2015 she developed a dyskinetic crisis which resulted in a 5 week admission to her local paediatric intensive care unit. Her CK rose to >7000. In June 2015 she underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS). Her movement disorder had been well-controlled since then. We have been able to titrate up a Gabapentin dose, resulting in improved seizure control. We present videos of her ataxic gait prior to the onset of the dyskinetic movement disorder; her movements during her dyskinetic crisis; and her improved condition since DBS. Discussion(s): This case broadens the phenotype associated with GNAO1 mutations to include a generalised epilepsy and paroxysmal movement disorder both presenting in mid-childhood. It also highlights how DBS may be a successful treatment in newly recognised genetic movement disorders.",4,,,
252,"Purpose: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of brain is an alternative therapeutic modality for patients with refractory epilepsy not feasible for resective surgery, or in whom surgery has failed. We provide a retrospective analysis of seizure outcomes after DBS on anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) from our registry (at least more than 1 year followed up), and evaluate the efficacy of this approach as a standard method for palliative seizure control. Method(s): Twenty-seven patients (seventeen men; age range, 16- 47 years; 13-126 months F/U) were enrolled for ATN DBS in Seoul St. Mary's Hospital. Seizure frequency was determined using daily seizure diaries Stimulation was delivered using a continuous, high-frequency Stimulation (130 Hz, 90 sec pulse width, voltage ranging from 1.5 to 3.0V). Seizure counts were monitored and compared with pre-implantation baseline. Result(s): Comparing to baseline, there was 67.8% mean seizure reduction in all patients. 22 among them (81.5%) showed clinically and statistically significant improvement (> 50% seizure reduction). Two patients (7.4%) remained seizure free for more than 1 year. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy showed a better improvement (74.9%) from ATN DBS compared to those with frontal (55.0%) or posterior dominant (56.8%) epilepsy (p < 0.01). However, there were no statistically significant clinical factors affecting favorable outcome after ATN DBS (cognitive derangement before operation, previous surgery, age at onset, duration of epilepsy, number of AED medication before surgery and major structural lesions in MRI). Device removal was performed in three patients because of infection (1 patient, 3.7%) or lack of efficacy (2 patients, 7.4%). There was no major bleeding associated with the operation. Conclusion(s): Our data suggests that ATN DBS appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment in patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Especially it may be effective in patients with bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy, which is not applicable to respective surgery.",27,,3.0,
253,"Introduction: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently considered a promising neuromodulation therapy for refractory epilepsy not suitable for resective surgery. several anatomical targets and different stimulation approaches have been proposed in order to obtain satisfactory seizures reduction. As expected, according with different patterns of neural pathways involvement, the eficacy of each anatomical target stimulation in reducing seizure frequency varies among the different epileptic syndromes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We reviewed the current literature on this topic to provide an overview of the clinical eficacy of the main stimulation targets (anterior nucleus of the thalamus [aNT], hippocampus formation [Hf] and centromedian nucleus of the thalamus [CMT]) related to the different epileptic syndromes. We also summarized the available data concerning side effects, neuropsychological outcome, quality of life and future perspective of DBs in intractable epilepsy. eViDeNce sYNTHesis: Encouraging results were reported for each target stimulation. However, only in aNT and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) the eficacy and safety were tested on large series of patients and achieving class I evidence level. Conslusions: We concluded that responsive stimulation could be more appropriate in focal epilepsy, while aNT stimulation could be properly performed also in multifocal seizures with predominant limbic involvement. Despite the small samples size, Hf stimulation reduces seizure frequency in (bi) temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as cMT stimulation is able to reduce, seizure frequency, in generalized epilepsy.Copyright © 2016 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.",0,,,
254,"Subcortical band heterotopia is a neuronal migration disorder that may cause refractory epilepsy. In these patients, resective surgery has yielded inadequate results. Deep brain stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus has been used for the treatment of refractory epilepsy with good results. We describe the first two patients with subcortical band heterotopia who were submitted to deep brain stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus, with evaluation of seizure outcome after 12 and 18 months of follow-up. At these times, both showed a >50% decrease in seizure frequency and an increase in seizure freedom. Both patients had a depressive syndrome after surgery that responded fully to anti-depressive medication in one patient and partly in the other. In both, deep brain stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus was associated with good seizure outcome. This procedure can therefore be considered in the treatment of patients with subcortical band heterotopia and refractory epilepsy. Depression may be a transient adverse event of the surgery or stimulation, however, its aetiology is probably multifactorial.Copyright © 2016 Epileptic Disorders",2,,,
255,"Over the past decade, rapid advances in the application of neurostimulation to refractory epilepsy have taken place. Alongside conventional extracranial stimulation such as vagus nerve stimulation, intracranial neurostimulation is becoming the mainstream of treatment. Regarding treatment response, large-scale randomized controlled studies with long-term follow-up have revealed that anterior thalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (ATN-DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) can both achieve nearly 50% reductions in seizure frequency for specific types of refractory epilepsy. As for safety, compared to general epilepsy patients, no significant increase in depression, status epilepticus, suicide, or sudden death were noted. Here we discuss the evolution of these two types of intracranial stimulation, summarize the latest research results, and conclude with a review of currently unresolved issues.Copyright © 2016, Neurological Society R.O.C (Taiwan).

256,"Background & Objective: Modulation of cortical excitability by low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated therapeutic use in epilepsy. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of low-frequency rTMS on refractory epilepsy in a group of Malaysian subjects. Method(s): Nine patients with refractory epilepsy completed the study. All patients received 10 sessions of 1Hz rTMS (1000 pulses per session) at 90% of resting motor threshold. Outcome measures included seizure frequency, Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31). Responders were defined as having >= 50% seizure reduction. Result(s): The mean age was 33.8 years (SD 11.7), with 4 male. Three patients had mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS); 4 with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and two lesion-negative. Three patients achieved >50% seizure reduction at 8 weeks post-treatment, with 2 of them had improvement in the number of IED. All of the responders had FCD. The responders were younger (mean 24.7 vs. 38.3 years old), had shorter duration of illness (mean 15.7 vs. 30.5 years) and had less frequent seizure frequency prior to treatment (mean 5.5 vs. 10.8 attacks per week), as compared to the non-responders. Six patients had improvement in BDI-II scores, two in QOLIE-31 and four in SCL-90 post treatment, irrespective of seizure control. The mean scores in BDI-II improved significantly with treatment (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): rTMS is a potentially promising treatment for epilepsy, especially in those with FCD, younger age, shorter duration of illness and lower seizure frequency.Copyright © 2016, ASEAN Neurological Association.

257,"We report the case of a 14-year-old male with a history of focal seizures since the age of six due to a focal cortical dysplasia located within the left frontal lobe. The patient's seizures proved to be refractory to treatments with Oxcarbazepine, Lamotrigine, Valproate, and Clobazame. Because fMRI for language mapping suggested a close spatial relationship of the lesion and Broca's area, invasive language mapping was performed using a subdural grid for direct cortical stimulation. This suggested a clear topographic distinction between the lesion and Broca's area, finally enabling language retaining lesionectomy. This case illustrates some pitfalls of fMRI language mapping in preoperative workup for epilepsy surgery.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0,,,

A 43-year-old woman who had had refractory epilepsy since the age of six years, for which she was treated with deep brain stimulation of the centromedian nucleus, and also a ring chromosome 20. Conclusions. From the findings of the study it can be concluded that deep brain stimulation of the centromedian nucleus is ineffective in patients with ring chromosome, but note must be taken of the importance of genetic characterisation for the management of refractory epilepsy.Copyright © 2015 Revista de Neurologia.",0,,,
259,"Purpose: The primary efficacy and safety measures from a trial of responsive neurostimulation for focal epilepsy were previously published. In this report, the findings from the same study are presented for quality of life, which was a supportive analysis, and for mood, which was assessed as a secondary safety endpoint. Method(s): The study was a multicenter randomized controlled double-blinded trial of responsive neurostimulation in 191 patients with medically resistant focal epilepsy. During a 4-month postimplant blinded period, patients were randomized to receive responsive stimulation or sham stimulation, after which all patients received responsive neurostimulation in open label to complete 2. years. Quality of life (QOL) and mood surveys were administered during the baseline period, at the end of the blinded period, and at year 1 and year 2 of the open label period. Result(s): The treatment and sham groups did not differ at baseline. Compared with baseline, QOL improved in both groups at the end of the blinded period and also at 1. year and 2. years, when all patients were treated. At 2. years, 44% of patients reported meaningful improvements in QOL, and 16% reported declines. There were no overall adverse changes in mood or in suicidality across the study. Findings were not related to changes in seizures and antiepileptic drugs, and patients with mesial temporal seizure onsets and those with neocortical seizure onsets both experienced improvements in QOL. Conclusion(s): Treatment with targeted responsive neurostimulation does not adversely affect QOL or mood and may be associated with improvements in QOL in patients, including those with seizures of either mesial temporal origin or neocortical origin.Copyright © 2015.",191,,,
260,"Objective: To report long-term efficacy and safety results of the SANTE trial investigating deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) for treatment of localization-related epilepsy. Method(s): This long-term follow-up is a continuation of a previously reported trial of 5-vs 0-V ANT stimulation. Long-term follow-up began 13 months after device implantation with stimulation parameters adjusted at the investigators' discretion. Seizure frequency was determined using daily seizure diaries. Result(s): The median percent seizure reduction from baseline at 1 year was 41%, and 69% at 5 years. The responder rate (>=50% reduction in seizure frequency) at 1 year was 43%, and 68% at 5 years. In the 5 years of follow-up, 16% of subjects were seizure-free for at least 6 months. There were no reported unanticipated adverse device effects or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages. The Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale and 31-item Quality of Life in Epilepsy measure showed statistically significant improvement over baseline by 1 year and at 5 years (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Long-term follow-up of ANT deep brain stimulation showed sustained efficacy and safety in a treatment-resistant population. Classification of evidence: This long-term follow-up provides Class IV evidence that for patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy, anterior thalamic stimulation is associated with a 69% reduction in seizure frequency and a 34% serious device-related adverse event rate at 5 years.Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.",0,,0.0,
261,"Objective: The long-term efficacy and safety of responsive direct neurostimulation was assessed in adults with medically refractory partial onset seizures. Method(s): All participants were treated with a cranially implanted responsive neurostimulator that delivers stimulation to 1 or 2 seizure foci via chronically implanted electrodes when specific electrocorticographic patterns are detected (RNS System). Participants had completed a 2-year primarily open-label safety study (n 65) or a 2-year randomized blinded controlled safety and efficacy study (n 191); 230 participants transitioned into an ongoing 7-year study to assess safety and efficacy. Result(s): The average participant was 34 (+/-11.4) years old with epilepsy for 19.6 (+/-11.4) years. The median preimplant frequency of disabling partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures was 10.2 seizures a month. The median percent seizure reduction in the randomized blinded controlled trial was 44% at 1 year and 53% at 2 years (p < 0.0001, generalized estimating equation) and ranged from 48% to 66% over postimplant years 3 through 6 in the long-term study. Improvements in quality of life were maintained (p < 0.05). The most common serious device-related adverse events over the mean 5.4 years of follow-up were implant site infection (9.0%) involving soft tissue and neurostimulator explantation (4.7%). Conclusion(s): The RNS System is the first direct brain responsive neurostimulator. Acute and sustained efficacy and safety were demonstrated in adults with medically refractory partial onset seizures arising from 1 or 2 foci over a mean follow-up of 5.4 years. This experience supports the RNS System as a treatment option for refractory partial seizures. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that for adults with medically refractory partial onset seizures, responsive direct cortical stimulation reduces seizures and improves quality of life over a mean follow-up of 5.4 years.Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.",0,,,
262,"Background: Drug-resistant motor epilepsies are particularly incapacitating for the patients. In a primate model of focal motor seizures induced by intracortical injection of penicillin, we recently showed that seizures propagated from the motor cortex towards the basal ganglia. Objective(s): Using the same animal model here, we hypothesized that disruption of subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity by chronic high frequency stimulation (HFS) could modify pathological excessive cortical synchronisation occurring during focal motor seizures, and therefore could reduce seizure activity. Method(s): Two monkeys were chronically implanted with one electrode positioned into the STN. In each experiment, seizures were induced during 6 hours by injecting penicillin into the motor cortex. During stimulation sessions, HFS-STN was applied at the beginning of penicillin injection. Result(s): Our results indicate that HFS-STN improved focal motor seizures by delaying the occurrence of the first seizure, by decreasing the number of seizures by 47% and therefore the total time spent seizing by 53% compared to control. These results argue for a therapeutic use of HFS-STN in motor seizures because they were obtained in a very severe primate model of motor status similar to that seen in human. Furthermore, HFS-STN was much more efficient than direct cortical HFS of the epileptic focus, which we already tested in the same primate model. Conclusion(s): The present study suggests that HFS-STN could be used as an experimental therapy when other therapeutic strategies are not possible or have failed in humans suffering from motor epilepsy but the present study still warrants controlled studies in humans.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
