surgical technique [m]","Drug-resistant focal epilepsy (DRFE), defined by failure of two antiepileptic drugs, affects 30% of epileptic patients. Epilepsy surgeries are alternative options for this population. Preoperative evaluation is critical to include potential candidates, and to choose the most appropriate procedure to maximize efficacy and simultaneously minimize side effects. Traditional procedures involve open skull surgeries and epileptic focus resection. Alternatively, neuromodulation surgeries use peripheral nerve or deep brain stimulation to reduce the activities of epileptogenic focus. With the advanced improvement of laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) technique and its utilization in neurosurgery, magnetic resonance-guided LITT (MRgLITT) emerges as a minimal invasive approach for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. In the present review, we first introduce drug-resistant focal epilepsy and summarize the indications, pros and cons of traditional surgical procedures and neuromodulation procedures. And then, focusing on MRgLITT, we thoroughly discuss its history, its technical details, its safety issues, and current evidence on its clinical applications. A case report on MRgLITT is also included to illustrate the preoperational evaluation. We believe that MRgLITT is a promising approach in selected patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, although large prospective studies are required to evaluate its efficacy and side effects, as well as to implement a standardized protocol for its application.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Method(s): The plasma levels of IL-1beta (interleukin 1beta), IL-6 (interleukin 6), UCH-L1 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1), MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) were assessed. The peripheral concentrations of the selected proteins were analyzed according to the status of kindling and seizure severity parameters. In our study, increased concentrations of plasma IL-1beta and IL-6 were observed in rats subjected to hippocampal kindling compared to sham-operated rats. Result(s): Animals that developed tonic-clonic seizures after the last stimulation had higher plasma concentrations of IL-1beta and IL-6 than sham-operated rats and rats that did not develop seizure. Elevated levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 were observed in rats that presented more severe seizures after the last five stimulations compared to sham-operated animals. A correlation between plasma IL-1beta and IL-6 concentrations was also found. On the other hand, the plasma levels of the brain-derived proteins UCH-L1, MMP-9, and GFAP were unaffected by kindling status and seizure severity parameters. Conclusion(s): The plasma concentrations of IL-1beta and IL-6 may have potential utility as peripheral biomarkers of immune system activation in the course of epilepsy and translational potential for future clinical use. Surprisingly, markers of cell and nerve ending damage (GFAP, UCH-L1 and MMP-9) may have limited utility.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Click here for full text options,,,,

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior thalamic nucleus (ANT) has been used for the treatment of refractory partial seizures. In the pilocarpine model of epilepsy, ANT DBS applied during status epilepticus (SE) reduces hippocampal inflammation and apoptosis. When given to chronic epileptic animals it reduces hippocampal excitability and seizure frequency. Here, we tested whether ANT DBS delivered during SE and the silent phase of the pilocarpine model would reduce cognitive impairment when animals became chronically epileptic. Material(s) and Method(s): SE was induced by a systemic pilocarpine injection (320 mg/kg). Immediately after SE onset, rats were assigned to receive DBS during the first six hours of SE (n = 8; DBSa group) or during SE + the silent period (i.e., 6 h/day until the animals developed the first spontaneous recurrent seizure; n = 10; DBSs group). Four months following SE, animals underwent water maze testing and histological evaluation. Nonstimulated chronic epileptic animals (n = 13; PCTL group) and age-matched naive rats (n = 11, CTL group) were used as controls. Results were analyzed by repeated-measures analyses of variance (RM_ANOVA) and one-way ANOVAs, followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. Result(s): Although all groups learned the spatial task, epileptic animals with or without DBS spent significantly less time in the platform quadrant, denoting a spatial memory deficit (p < 0.02). Despite these negative behavioral results, we found that animals given DBS had a significantly higher number of cells in the CA1 region and dentate gyrus. Mossy fiber sprouting was similar among all epileptic groups. Conclusion(s): Despite lesser hippocampal neuronal loss, ANT DBS delivered either during SE or during SE and the silent phase of the pilocarpine model did not mitigate memory deficits in chronic epileptic rats.Copyright © 2017 International Neuromodulation Society",Click here for full text options,,,,

upregulation","The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is ubiquitous in the central nervous system (CNS) throughout life. In addition to trophic effects on target neurons, BDNF appears to be part of a general mechanism for activity-dependent modification of synapses in the developing and adult nervous system. Thus, diseases of abnormal trophic support (such as neurodegenerative diseases) and diseases of abnormal excitability (such as epilepsy and central pain sensitization) can be related in some cases to abnormal BDNF signaling. For example, various studies have shown that BDNF is upregulated in areas implicated in epileptogenesis, and interference with BDNF signal transduction inhibits the development of the epileptic state. Further study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which BDNF influences cell survival and excitability will likely provide novel concepts and targets for the treatment of diverse CNS diseases.",Click here for full text options,,,,

A canonical view holds that seizures, the characteristic sign of epilepsy, occur at random, but, for centuries, humans have looked for patterns of temporal organization in seizure occurrence. Observations that seizures are cyclical date back to antiquity, but recent technological advances have, for the first time, enabled cycles of seizure occurrence to be quantitatively characterized with direct brain recordings. Chronic recordings of brain activity in humans and in animals have yielded converging evidence for the existence of cycles of epileptic brain activity that operate over diverse timescales: daily (circadian), multi-day (multidien) and yearly (circannual). Here, we review this evidence, synthesizing data from historical observational studies, modern implanted devices, electronic seizure diaries and laboratory-based animal neurophysiology. We discuss advances in our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of these cycles and highlight the knowledge gaps that remain. The potential clinical applications of a knowledge of cycles in epilepsy, including seizure forecasting and chronotherapy, are discussed in the context of the emerging concept of seizure risk. In essence, this Review addresses the broad question of why seizures occur when they occur.Copyright © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.",Click here for full text options,clock gene [other term],electroencephalograph electrode,,

Epilepsy misdiagnosis, to which factors such as EEG artifact misinterpretation contribute to, is common, and can have long-lasting iatrogenic repercussions to the clinical management of affected patients. Among the many types of responses to photic stimulation, artifacts and physiologic and epileptic responses are possible. All of these can interfere with EEG interpretation when provoked by a source of illumination. Photic-induced responses are of increasing relevance given the ubiquity of screens and other light-emitting electronics in our modern world. One of these, the photoparoxysmal response, is a frequent finding in photosensitive patients with genetic generalized epilepsies. Various responses beyond abnormal occurrence of cortical spikes or spike-and-wave discharges are known to occur on EEG in response to intermittent photic stimulation (IPS), with different clinical implications. To our knowledge, we report a unique electronegative photoparoxysmal response during video-EEG monitoring induced by fluctuating illumination caused by a distant television screen. This response mimicked an extratemporal seizure in a young woman with frontal lobe epilepsy, admitted for presurgical evaluation. Novel electronegative responses to electronic devices during video-EEG monitoring merit consideration by EEG interpreters to help avoid misdiagnosis.Copyright © 2021 Epileptic Disorders",Click here for full text options,,"electronics

Seven patients with intractable focal epilepsy, in which FEFs were identified by electrical cortical stimulation, were enrolled in this study. Electric stimulation at 50 Hz was applied to the electrodes for functional mapping. DTI was used to identify the subcortical fibers originating from the FEFs with two regions of interests (ROIs) in the FEF and contralateral paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). FEFs were found in the superior precentral sulcus (pre-CS) in six patients and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in three patients. DTI detected fibers connecting FEFs and contralateral PPRFs, passing within the internal capsule. The fibers were located close to the lateral ante-ro-superior border of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and medial posterior border of the globus pallidus internus (GPi). This study found the characteristic subcortical networks of the FEF.

For patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, the Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) System (NeuroPace, Inc.) provides treatment of seizures with a closed-loop device that continuously records brain activity and provides stimulation designed to reduce seizure frequency over time. The presence of a chronic implanted device that can provide an electrographic record of neural activity provides great opportunities for treatment of seizure disorders and neuroscience research. However, our experience with this device indicates that a number of ethical and clinical challenges arise, and these issues may be applicable to neurotechnology developed for other disease states in the future. We present clinical scenarios based on cases from our center that present clinical or ethical dilemmas. The dilemmas revolve around 4 core themes: (1) electroclinical correlation and dissociation; (2) patient concerns about device capabilities; (3) clinician opportunities and burdens; and (4) data ownership and access. Developing a framework for understanding these issues will be critical as closed-loop neuromodulation is applied to a growing range of neuropsychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Neurology.",Click here for full text options,,,,

vagus nerve stimulation","For a subset of children with medically intractable epilepsy, surgery may provide the best chances of seizure freedom. Whereas the indications for epilepsy surgery are commonly thought to be limited to patients with focal epileptogenic foci, modern imaging and surgical interventions frequently permit successful surgical treatment of generalized epilepsy. Resection continues to be the only potentially curative intervention; however, the advent of various neuromodulation interventions provides an effective palliative strategy for generalized or persistent seizures. Although the risks and benefits vary greatly by type and extent of intervention, the seizure outcomes appear to be uniformly favorable. Advances in both resective and nonresective surgical interventions provide promise for improved seizure freedom, function, and quality of life. This review summarizes the current trends and recent advancements in pediatric epilepsy surgery from diagnostic workup and indications through surgical interventions and postoperative outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

In this work, we introduce a basic model of spontaneous seizure dynamics and construct from it to a network model of focal-onset seizure dynamics. The full model is composed of coupled oscillators with scale-free network connectivity and a common slow variable. We find that global parameter changes and variation of the connectivity can drive the model from a quiescent state to recurrent seizures, and, eventually, to a permanent-seizure-state. Based on network synchronization features we design a stimulation scheme for the control of the fraction of nodes with strongest phase locking is proposed. Simulations lead to the identification of optimal stimuli for a given type of dynamics. Our results contribute to the development of a rational strategy for the non-surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy.Copyright © 2001-2011 IEEE.",Click here for full text options,*focal epileptogenic network model [other term],oscillator,,

As new drugs have become available, others have been withdrawn, new indications have been approved and recommendations for pregnant women have changed, a new update was pertinent. A group of Belgian epilepsy experts (partly overlapping with the group in charge of the 2008/2012 recommendations) evaluated the most recent international guidelines and relevant literature for their applicability to the Belgian situation (registration status, reimbursement, clinical practice) and updated the recommendations for initial monotherapy in adults and children and add-on treatment in adults. Recommendations for add-on treatment in children were also included (not covered in the 2008/2012 publications). Like the 2008/2012 publications, the current update also covers other important aspects related to the management of epilepsy, including the importance of early referral in drug-resistant epilepsy, pharmacokinetic properties and tolerability of AEDs, comorbidities, specific considerations in elderly and pregnant patients, generic substitution and the rapidly evolving field of precision medicine.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Click here for full text options,,,,

In this article, we review data from recent literature and from our stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings in patients referred for temporal lobe epilepsy surgery (TLE). Our description of the clinical features of insular lobe seizures is based on data from video and SEEG ictal recordings and direct electric cortical stimulation in a population of 50 consecutive patients whose seizures, on the basis of scalp video EEG recordings, were suspected to originate from, or to rapidly propagate to, the peri-sylvian cortex. A total of 144 intra-insular electrodes have been implanted in this series of patients. In six patients a stereotyped sequence of ictal symptoms could be identified on the basis of electroclinical correlations. The clinical presentation of insular lobe seizures was that of simple partial seizures occurring in full consciousness, beginning with a sensation of laryngeal constriction followed by paresthesiae that were often unpleasant affecting large cutaneous territories. These initial symptoms were eventually followed by dysarthric speech and/or elementary auditory hallucinations, and seizures often ended with focal dystonic postures. The insular origin of these symptoms was supported by the data from functional cortical mapping of the insula using direct cortical stimulations. We were able to reproduce several of the spontaneous ictal symptoms in the six patients with insular seizures. Moreover, from the whole set of insular stimulations that we performed it could be concluded that the insular cortex is involved in somatic, vegetative and visceral functions to which spontaneous ictal insular symptoms are related. The observation of the insular symptoms sequence at the onset of seizures in patients who are candidates for TLE surgery strongly suggests that the epileptic focus is located in the insular lobe. It entails the risk of unsuccessful temporal lobectomy and should lead: i) to reconsider the indication of temporal lobectomy and; ii) to explore directly the ictal activity of both mesio-temporal and insular cortices before making any decision regarding epilepsy surgery.",Click here for full text options,,,Le lobe de l'insula et les epilepsies partielles.,

The deep location and small size of the ATN have precluded their real-time electrophysiological investigation during human memory processing. However, ATN electrophysiological recordings from patients receiving electrodes implanted for deep brain stimulation for pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy have enabled high temporal resolution study of ATN activity. Theta frequency synchronization of ATN and neocortical oscillations during successful memory encoding, enhanced phase alignment, and coupling between ATN local gamma frequency activity and frontal neocortical and ATN theta oscillations provide evidence of an active role for the ATN in memory encoding, potentially integrating information from widespread neocortical sources. Greater coupling of a broader gamma frequency range with theta oscillations at rest than during memory encoding provides additional support for the hypothesis that the ATN play a role in selecting local, task-relevant high frequency activity associated with particular features of a memory trace.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Click here for full text options,,,,

All underwent chronic long-term video/EEG monitoring, cortical mapping by 50 Hz electric cortical stimulation and recording of cortical somatosensory evoked potentials with chronically implanted subdural grid electrodes (3 mm in diameter and centre-to-centre distance of 1 cm) to map both epileptogenic and functional zones. After these clinical evaluations, cortical stimulation by single electric pulse (0.3 ms duration, 1 Hz) was carried out through pairs of subdural electrodes located at the primary sensorimotor area (MI-SI), pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and lateral negative motor area (lateral NMA), while surface EMG was recorded from the muscles of the contralateral hand. The results showed that (i) in all subjects, single pulse stimulation of MI-SI elicited a motor evoked potential (MEP) followed by a silent period (SP) in the contralateral distal hand muscles, the latter lasting 300 ms after the stimulus. The duration of SP was proportional to the size of the preceding MEP. In one subject, SP without any preceding MEP was elicited, and, in another subject, there was a short SP immediately before MEP in the contralateral thenar muscle. (ii) Following the stimulation of either pre-SMA or lateral NMA, no SP was observed. It is concluded that the inhibitory mechanism within the MI-SI, but probably not in the non-primary motor areas, either closely linked to or completely independent of excitation, most likely plays an important role in eliciting brief negative motor phenomena such as cortical negative myoclonus or SP.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and accuracy of robot-assisted stereotactic electrode placement in the limbic thalamic nuclei of patients with suspected temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). METHOD(S): After providing informed consent, 24 adults with drug-resistant, suspected TLE undergoing evaluation with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) were enrolled in the prospective study. The trajectory of one electrode planned for clinical sampling of the operculoinsular cortex was modified to extend it to the thalamus, thereby preventing the need for additional electrode placement for research. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) (n = 13) and the medial group of thalamic nuclei (MED) (n = 11), including the mediodorsal and centromedian nuclei, were targeted. The postimplantation CT scan was coregistered to the preoperative MR image, and Morel's thalamic atlas was used to confirm the accuracy of implantation. RESULT(S): Ten (77%) of 13 patients in the ANT group and 10 (91%) of 11 patients in the MED group had electrodes accurately placed in the thalamic nuclei. None of the patients had a thalamic hemorrhage. However, trace asymptomatic hemorrhages at the cortical-level entry site were noted in 20.8% of patients, who did not require additional surgical intervention. SEEG data from all the patients were interpretable and analyzable. The trajectories for the ANT implant differed slightly from those of the MED group at the entry point-i.e., the precentral gyrus in the former and the postcentral gyrus in the latter. CONCLUSION(S): Using judiciously planned robot-assisted SEEG, the authors demonstrate the safety of electrophysiological sampling from various thalamic nuclei for research recordings, presenting a technique that avoids implanting additional depth electrodes or compromising clinical care. With these results, we propose that if patients are fully informed of the risks involved, there are potential benefits of gaining mechanistic insights to seizure genesis, which may help to develop neuromodulation therapies.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Microlesioning of the target structure has been postulated to be the cause of this ""insertional"" effect (IE). We examined the occurrence and duration of this IE in a group of patients with focal epilepsy following electrode implantation in the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT) and/or nucleus accumbens (NAC) for DBS treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): Changes in monthly seizure frequency compared to preoperative baseline were assessed one month (14 patients) and five months (four patients) after electrode implantation. A group analysis between patients with implantation of bilateral ANT-electrodes (four patients), NAC-electrodes (one patient) as well as ANT and NAC-electrodes (nine patients) was performed. Result(s): In this cohort, seizure frequency decreased one month after electrode implantation by 57.1 +/- 30.1%, p <= 0.001 (compared to baseline). No significant difference within stimulation target subcohorts was found (p > 0.05). Out of the four patients without stimulation for five months following electrode insertion, three patients showed seizure frequency reduction lasting two to three months, while blinded to their stimulation status. Conclusion(s): An IE might explain seizure frequency reduction in our cohort. This effect seems to be independent of the number of implanted electrodes and of the target itself. The time course of the blinded subgroup of epilepsy patients suggests a peak of the lesional effect at two to three months after electrode insertion.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

weight reduction","The epilepsies are one of the most common serious brain disorders, can occur at all ages, and have many possible presentations and causes. Although incidence in childhood has fallen over the past three decades in developed countries, this reduction is matched by an increase in elderly people. Monogenic Mendelian epilepsies are rare. A clinical syndrome often has multiple possible genetic causes, and conversely, different mutations in one gene can lead to various epileptic syndromes. Most common epilepsies, however, are probably complex traits with environmental effects acting on inherited susceptibility, mediated by common variation in particular genes. Diagnosis of epilepsy remains clinical, and neurophysiological investigations assist with diagnosis of the syndrome. Brain imaging is making great progress in identifying the structural and functional causes and consequences of the epilepsies. Current antiepileptic drugs suppress seizures without influencing the underlying tendency to generate seizures, and are effective in 60-70% of individuals. Pharmacogenetic studies hold the promise of being able to better individualise treatment for each patient, with maximum possibility of benefit and minimum risk of adverse effects. For people with refractory focal epilepsy, neurosurgical resection offers the possibility of a life-changing cure. Potential new treatments include precise prediction of seizures and focal therapy with drug delivery, neural stimulation, and biological grafts. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Method(s): Twenty-five patients submitted to Hip-DBS were studied. All patients were evaluated with interictal and ictal electroencephalography (EEG) and high-resolution 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The hippocampus was targeted directly on MRI using a posterior occipital burr hole approach. Bipolar continuous stimulation was ramped up until 3.0 V (300 micros, 130 Hz). Patients were considered responders if at least 50% seizure frequency reduction was obtained. Result(s): Median age was 39 years; median follow-up time was 57 months (16 women). All patients had focal with impaired awareness seizure (FIAS) and 23 patients had focal aware seizure (FAS). Baseline median FAS and FIAS frequency was 8. Ictal EEG showed unilateral (n = 10) or bilateral (n = 15) seizure onset. MRI showed unilateral (n = 11) or bilateral (n = 8) mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and was normal in six6 patients. Fifteen patients were submitted to bilateral and 10 patients to unilateral Hip-DBS. Median reduction in FAS frequency was 66%. Eighteen patients with FAS were considered responders and five (21%) were free of FAS. Median FIAS frequency (n = 25) reduction was 91%. Twenty-two patients were considered responders and eight (32%) were free of FIAS. FIAS were significantly more reduced then FAS (P =.017). There was no relation between any contact's position within the hippocampus and outcome for either FAS (P =.727) or FIAS (P =.410). There was no difference in outcome in patients submitted to either unilateral or bilateral Hip-DBS regarding FAS (P =.978) or FIAS (P =.693). Significance: Hip-DBS significantly reduced the frequency of both FAS and FIAS in this cohort of patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Hip-DBS might represent a good therapeutic option in such patients not amenable to resective surgery.Copyright © 2020 International League Against Epilepsy",Click here for full text options,,"anode electrode

We aimed to present the clinical and electrophysiological features of patients with epileptic vertigo with a view to addressing the pathophysiology of this rare aura symptom. Methods. Nine epileptic vertigo patients were included in the study. All patients were subjected to neuro-otologic examination, interictal electroencephalogram (EEG), audiogram, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing (cVEMP), video head impulse testing (vHIT) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results. Eight patients described their aura as epileptic vertigo and one as dizziness. In three patients, auditory hallucinations preceded epileptic vertigo. The semiology of epileptic vertigo was true vertigo in five patients, vertigo with nausea in two patients and vertigo with hearing loss in one patient. Two patients suffered from focal seizures, and in seven patients the seizures were evaluated as focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. MRI was normal in all patients. EEG was abnormal in all cases and showed high-voltage spike or spike-slow-wave complexes, or both, located more frequently in the temporal region, more left than right. On vHIT examination, abnormal responses were recorded bilaterally or unilaterally in five patients. Similarly, cVEMP revealed no response bilaterally or unilaterally in five patients. In three patients, the side of no response to cVEMP corresponded to the side of epileptiform pathology based on EEG. Two patients with bilateral abnormalities on EEG showed bilateral abnormalities either on cVEMP or vHIT, or on both. Taken together, these findings support the involvement of the brainstem connections of the peripheral vestibular system in vertiginous epilepsy. Conclusion. The pathological results of vestibular tests in the majority of our patients, combined with the EEG abnormalities, support the hypothesis of system epilepsies which is based on the dysfunction of specific neural systems.Copyright © 2020 Epileptic Disorders",Click here for full text options,"vertiginous epilepsy / drug therapy [other term]

These phenomena are rare and the anatomy of brain regions producing these phenomena is not well defined. We report anatomical electroclinical correlations during a stereoelectroencephalography-recorded seizure with autoscopic hallucination (a form of AP in which the double of oneself is seen from an internal point of view). Seizure onset zone was quantified using the epileptogenicity index method (EI). Maximal EI values were obtained in the left lateral parietal cortex (supramarginal gyrus) and high values were also found in the left posterior-superior insular cortex, left temporo-occipital junction and contralateral inferior parietal lobule. Our case confirms the involvement of the inferior parietal lobule, temporo-parieto-occipital junction and posterior insula in the genesis of autoscopic hallucination.Copyright © 2020 Epileptic Disorders",Click here for full text options,,,,

We report simultaneous microelectrode recordings (MERs) from the globus pallidus internus (GPi) of a patient with SD who was treated with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS). Mean neuronal discharge rate was of 30.1 +/- 10.9 Hz and 38.5 Hz +/- 11.1 Hz for the right and left GPi, respectively. On the right side, neuronal electrical activity was completely abolished at the target point, whereas the mean burst index values showed a predominance of bursting and irregular activity along trajectories on both sides. Our data are in line with previous findings of pallidal irregular hypoactivity as a potential electrophysiological marker of dystonia and thus SD, but further electrophysiological studies are needed to confirm our results.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Click here for full text options,"burke fahn marsden dystonia rating scale [other term]

In this review, we discuss the use of repetitive TMS as a means of suppressing cortical hyperexcitability in drug-resistant epilepsies. The theoretical background and the experimental evidence in favor of this novel therapeutic approach are presented, and a number of open-label and controlled studies in patients with various forms of focal epilepsy are reviewed. It is concluded that, although the therapeutic effects of repetitive TMS in epilepsy appear rather limited, further clinical testing of this rapidly evolving technology is warranted.

Neurostimulatory options comprise vagal nerve stimulation, trigeminal nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS enables structures in the brain to be stimulated electrically by an implanted pacemaker after a minimally invasive neurosurgical procedure and has become the therapy of choice for Parkinson's disease refractory to or complicated by drug therapy.

society","Background:: Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus alleviates motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients. However, some patients suffer from cognitive and emotional changes. These side effects are most likely caused by current spread to the cognitive and limbic territories in the subthalamic nucleus. The aim of this study was to identify the motor part of the subthalamic nucleus to reduce stimulation-induced behavioral side effects, by using motor cortex stimulation. Method(s):: We describe the results of subthalamic nucleus neuronal responses to stimulation of the hand area of the motor cortex and evaluate the safety of this novel technique. Result(s):: Responses differed between regions within the subthalamic nucleus. In the anterior and lateral electrode at dorsal levels of the subthalamic nucleus, an early excitation (~5-45 ms) and subsequent inhibition (45-105 ms) were seen. The lateral electrode also showed a late excitation (~125-160 ms). Focal seizures were observed following motor cortex stimulation. Conclusion(s):: To prevent seizures the current density should be lowered, so that motor cortex stimulation-evoked responses can be safely used during deep brain stimulation surgery. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society.",Click here for full text options,,,,

symptom","A crucial element of the surgical treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is to delineate cortical areas that must be spared in order to avoid clinically relevant neurological and neuropsychological deficits postoperatively. For each patient, this typically necessitates determining the language lateralization between hemispheres and language localization within hemisphere. Understanding cortical language systems is complicated by two primary challenges: the extent of the neural tissue involved and the substantial variability across individuals, especially in pathological populations. We review the contributions made through the study of electrophysiological activity to address these challenges. These contributions are based on the techniques of magnetoencephalography (MEG), intracerebral recordings, electrical-cortical stimulation (ECS), and the electrovideo analyses of seizures and their semiology. We highlight why no single modality alone is adequate to identify cortical language systems and suggest avenues for improving current practice.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): We reviewed 145 sequential cases of patients with refractory focal epilepsy who underwent intracranial electrode implantation and extraoperative direct cortical stimulation (CS) for functional mapping. CS intended for mapping can elicit as a by-product electrical or electroclinical events, such as afterdischarges, subclinical EEG seizures, and stimulation-induced seizures (SIS). SIS may have habitual or non-habitual semiology (as defined by comparison to the patient's spontaneous events). Result(s): In our cohort, electrical (subclinical EEG seizures) or electroclinical events, (SIS) were recorded in 34.5% (50/145) patients during CS. SIS occurred in 23.4% (34/145) of all patients, of which over half were habitual SIS (SIShab). In most cases the location of contacts eliciting habitual SIS originated from the same location as the spontaneous ictal onset zone in icEEG. Of those with SIS hab undergoing surgery (n = 13), seizure freedom was achieved in 61.5%, and of those with SISNH undergoing surgery (n = 10), 40% became seizure free (ns). Conclusion(s): Electroclinical SIS occur in about a quarter of CS for functional mapping; SIS are habitual in the majority of cases, and where elicited, SIS in icEEG could be an additional diagnostic tool to localize the seizure onset zone. However, a significant minority of stimulations lead to non-habitual SIS.Copyright © 2020",Click here for full text options,"*extraoperative direct electrical cortical stimulation [other term]

Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed all leukemia patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT between January 2010 and December 2018. The clinical, radiological, electroencephalographic, and CSF features of those with HHV6 encephalitis were recorded. Result(s): A total of five cases of HHV6 encephalitis were identified. Three patients had Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, one had Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and one had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. All of them presented a few months after transplantation with altered mental status. Comorbidities included pancytopenia, sepsis, graft versus host disease, and multi-organ failure. EEG showed focal seizures originating from temporal lobes in two patients, generalized or focal periodic discharges in three patients, focal slowing in two patients, and diffuse slowing in three patients. MRI brain showed T2/FLAIR hyper-intensities in four patients; two of them in bilateral temporal lobes, one in the thalamus/hypothalamus/brainstem/cerebellum/basal ganglia, and one in the periventricular areas. CSF showed pleocytosis, high protein, and positive HHV-6 PCR. Foscarnet was used as an anti-viral agent. Anti-epileptics used were phenytoin, levetiracetam, and valproic acid. Four patients died in a few months, whereas one recovered completely. Conclusion(s): HHV-6 encephalitis can add significant morbidity and mortality to leukemic patients following allogeneic HSCT. Patients present with typical clinical features of encephalitis. Salient EEG characteristics include periodic discharges or overt temporal lobe seizures. MRI findings are T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensities, mainly in the temporal lobes.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Click here for full text options,,,,

thalamus medialis centralis nucleus","Objective: The aim of the study was to determine if corticothalamic responsive stimulation targeting the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CMT) is a potential treatment for neocortical epilepsies with regional onsets. Method(s): We assessed efficacy and safety of CMT and neocortical responsive stimulation, detection, and stimulation programming, methods for implantation, and location and patterns of electrographic seizure onset and spread in 7 patients with medically intractable focal seizures with a regional neocortical onset. Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 17 months (average: 17 months, range: 8-28 months). The median % reduction in disabling seizures (excludes auras) in the 7 patients was 88% (mean: 80%, range: 55-100%). The median % reduction in all seizure types (disabling + auras) was 73% (mean: 67%, range: 15-94%). There were no adverse events related to implantation of the responsive neurostimulator and leads or related to the delivery of responsive stimulation. Stimulation-related contralateral paresthesias were addressed by adjusting stimulation parameters in the clinic during stimulation testing. Electrographic seizures were detected in the CMT and neocortex in all seven patients. Four patients had simultaneous or near simultaneous seizure onsets in the neocortex and CMT and three had onsets in the neocortex with spread to the CMT. Conclusion(s): In this small series of patients with medically intractable focal seizures and regional neocortical onset, responsive neurostimulation to the neocortex and CMT improved seizure control and was well tolerated. Significance: Responsive corticothalamic neurostimulation of the CMT and neocortex is a potential treatment for patients with regional neocortical epilepsies.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Click here for full text options,,,,

Up to now stimulation of the fornix, nucleus basalis of Meynert and entorhinal cortex have been found to enhance memory performance. Here, we provide an overview of the different DBS targets and mechanisms within the memory circuit, which could be relevant for enhancing memory in patients.

Some neuromodulation techniques for refractory epilepsy have been reported to positively influence the associated chronic headache. However, the exact mechanism of action of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and anterior thalamic nuclei-deep brain stimulation (ANT-DBS) on pain perception is unclear. Method We report a structured assessment of pain perception in a patient who experienced headache relief after ANT-DBS for refractory focal epilepsy and compare it with pain perception of epilepsy patients with chronic headache who were treated with and without VNS. Results The pain-associated symptoms in the ANT-DBS case were on the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS-40) subscore physiological anxiety closer to the control collective, whereas in patients with VNS, this was more likely for the PASS-40 subscores cognitive anxiety or escape and avoidance.

visual illusion","OBJECTIVE Experiential phenomena (EP), such as illusions and complex hallucinations, are vivid experiences created in one's mind. They can occur spontaneously as epileptic auras or can be elicited by electrical brain stimulation (EBS) in patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy. Previous work suggests that EP arise from activation of different nodes within interconnected neural networks mainly in the temporal lobes. Yet, the anatomical extent of these neural networks has not been described and the question of lateralization of EP has not been fully addressed. To this end, an extended number of brain regions in which electrical stimulation elicited EP were studied to test whether there is a lateralization propensity to EP phenomena. METHODS A total of 19 drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients who underwent EBS as part of invasive presurgical evaluation and who experienced EP during the stimulation were included. Spatial dispersion of visual and auditory illusions and complex hallucinations in each hemisphere was determined by calculation of Euclidean distances between electrodes and their centroid in common space, based on (x, y, z) Cartesian coordinates of electrode locations. RESULTS In total, 5857 stimulation epochs were analyzed; 917 stimulations elicited responses, out of which 130 elicited EP. Complex visual hallucinations were found to be widely dispersed in the right hemisphere, while they were tightly clustered in the occipital lobe of the left hemisphere. Visual illusions were elicited mostly in the occipital lobes bilaterally. Auditory illusions and hallucinations were evoked symmetrically in the temporal lobes. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that complex visual hallucinations arise from wider spread in the right compared to the left hemisphere, possibly mirroring the asymmetry in the white matter organization of the two hemispheres. These results offer some insights into lateralized differences in functional organization and connectivity that may be important for functional mapping and planning of surgical resections in patients with epilepsy.Copyright © 2020 AANS.",Click here for full text options,"auditory illusion [other term]

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a recently recognized therapeutic option for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. To identify the specific target for focal motor seizures, we evaluate the modulatory effects of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation because of the critical role of STN in cortico-subcortical motor processing. Method(s): Seven patients with epilepsy with refractory seizures who underwent chronic stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) monitoring were studied in presurgical evaluation. Seizure onset zone was hypothesized to be partially involved in the motor areas in 6 patients. For each patient, one electrode was temporally implanted into the STN that was ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone. The cortical-subcortical seizure propagation was systemically evaluated. The simultaneously electrophysiological responses over distributed cortical areas to STN stimulation at varied frequencies were quantitatively assessed. Result(s): We observed the consistent downstream propagation of seizures from the motor cortex toward the ipsilateral STN and remarkable cortical responses on motor cortex to single-pulse STN stimulation. Furthermore, we showed frequency-dependent upstream modulatory effect of STN stimulation on motor cortex specifically. In contrast to the enhanced effects of low frequency stimulation, high-frequency stimulation of the STN can significantly reduce interictal spikes, high-frequency oscillations over motor cortex disclosing effective connections to the STN. Interpretation(s): This result showed that the STN is not only engaged in as a propagation network of focal motor seizures but STN stimulation can profoundly modulate the epileptic activity of motor cortex in humans, suggesting a mechanism-based alternative for patients suffering from refractory focal motor seizures.

A comprehensive review of the current and emerging international practices in paediatric epilepsy surgical planning and post-operative imaging is provided with details on case-based radiological findings. A detailed discussion of the pathophysiology and imaging features of different epileptogenic lesions will not be discussed as this is not the objective of this paper. Epilepsy surgery can be an effective method to control seizures in certain children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Early surgery in selected appropriate cases can lead to improved cognitive and developmental outcome. Advances in neurosurgical techniques, imaging and neuroanaesthesia have driven a parallel expansion in the array of epilepsy conditions which are potentially treatable with surgery. The range of surgical options is now wide, including minimally invasive ablative procedures for small lesions such as hypothalamic hamartomata, resections for focal lesions like hippocampal sclerosis and complex disconnective surgeries for multilobar conditions like Sturge Weber Syndrome and diffuse cortical malformations. An awareness of the surgical thinking when planning epilepsy surgery in children, and the practical knowledge of the operative steps involved will promote more accurate radiology reporting of the post-operative scan.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Click here for full text options,"corpus callosotomy [other term]

To elucidate these issues, we analyzed simultaneous SEEG recordings in HH and cortex systematically. Method(s): We retrospectively investigated data from 15 consecutive patients with SEEG electrodes into the HH for the treatment purpose of radiofrequency thermocoagulation treatment. Additional SEEG electrodes were placed into the cortex in 11 patients to assess extra-HH involvement. Interictal discharges within the HH and anatomo-electroclinical correlations during seizures of each patient were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Result(s): Overall, 77 electrodes with 719 contacts were implanted, and 33 spontaneous seizures were recorded during long-term SEEG monitoring. Interictally, distinct electrophysiological patterns, including isolated intermittent spikes/sharp waves, burst spike and wave trains, paroxysmal fast discharges, periodic discharges, and high-frequency oscillations, were identified within the HH. Notably, synchronized or independent interictal discharges in the cortex were observed. Regarding the ictal discharges, the electrical onset pattern within the HH always started with abrupt giant shifts superimposed on low-voltage fast activity across patients. The gelastic seizure network mainly involved the HH, orbitofrontal areas, and cingulate gyrus. Seizures with automatisms and impaired awareness primarily propagated to mesial temporal lobes. Moreover, independent ictal discharges arising from the mesial temporal lobe were detected in three out of nine patients. Interpretation(s): This study comprehensively reveals intrinsic electrophysiological patterns and epileptogenic networks in vivo, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying cortical and subcortical epileptogenesis.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Models of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) have evolved considerably over the years with more recent models accounting for the connectivity and network properties of epileptic foci. Next, we describe several examples of network phenotypes of focal epilepsy and how these have the potential to influence surgical decision-making and patient outcome. Future research will provide new insight into how network models of the EZ can determine optimal surgical interventions that improve seizure outcomes and optimize cognitive outcomes.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

vagus nerve stimulation","Introduction: Despite the advances in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, approximately 30% of the patients remain intractable. Uncontrolled seizures have deleterious consequences, including brain damage, cognitive decline, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Areas covered: In this article, the authors discuss the treatment gap in patients with intractable epilepsy and the possible mechanisms of drug resistance. The authors provide a treatment algorithm for patients with intractable epilepsy, including non-pharmacological treatment options, such as diet, neurostimulation (vagus nerve stimulation, responsive neurostimulation, and deep brain stimulation), curative surgeries, and palliative surgeries. Expert opinion: There are currently several gaps in the management of seizures. Thirty percent of the 1% of the population with epilepsy is drug resistant. Non-pharmacologic treatments have improved in the last 30 years and continue to do so, but epilepsy surgery in general is still vastly under-utilized. Resective surgery is the only potentially curative procedure. Neurostimulation is generally palliative and is also improving, with smarter types of neurostimulation and paradigms.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Studies have shown that low-frequency (LFS) fiber-tract stimulation may also prove effective. To compare the efficacy of high-frequency grey matter stimulation to the low-frequency fiber tract stimulation technique a well-controlled set of experiments using a single animal model of epilepsy is needed. Objective(s): The goal of this study was to determine the relative efficacy of different direct brain stimulation techniques for suppressing seizures using an acute rat model of focal cortical seizures. Method(s): 4-AP was injected into the S1 region of cortex in rodents over 3 h. LFPs were recorded from the seizure focus and mirror focus to monitor seizure frequency during the experiments. CC-LFS, HFS-ANT, Focal-HFS, or a transection of the CC was applied. Result(s): Stimulation of the CC yielded a 65% +/-14% (p = 0.0014) reduction of seizures in the focus and a 97% +/-15% (p = 0.0026) reduction in the mirror focus (n = 7). By comparison transection of the CC produced a 65% +/-18% reduction in the focus and a non-statistically significant reduction of 57% +/-18% (p = 0.1381) in the mirror focus (n = 5). All other methods of stimulation failed to have a statistically significant effect on seizure suppression. Conclusion(s): LFS of the CC is the only method of stimulation to significantly reduce seizure frequency in this model of focal cortical seizures. These results support the hypothesis that LFSof fiber tracts has significant potential for seizure control.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s)",Click here for full text options,"*focal cortical epilepsy / *therapy [other term]

seizure / therapy","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) may help control seizures in individuals with medically intractable epilepsy who are not candidates for resective surgery. The current review focuses on some preclinical studies of DBS of the piriform cortex (PC), an area involved in the generation and maintenance of seizures, as a potential therapeutic option for refractory epilepsy. We also present findings suggesting the safety of low frequency stimulation (LFS) of the PC on memory. A variety of LFS parameters have been suggested as an effective treatment strategy for refractory epilepsy. In generalized epilepsy, however, recent studies suggest that LFS may exacerbate seizures and high frequency stimulation (HFS) might be an alternative. Hence, further studies are required to explore the potential therapeutic targets and proper stimulation parameters for the successful translation of DBS of the PC to the clinic.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

videorecording","Introduction: Stereo-EEG (sEEG) is a technique used to localize the seizure-onset zone for epilepsy surgery in people with drug-resistant focal seizures. Pathological crying reflects disordered emotional expression and the anterior insula is known to play a role in empathy and socio-emotional processing. We describe a patient where direct electrical stimulation of the anterior insula during sEEG generated pathological crying and profound sadness. Case Report/Case History: A 35-year-old left-handed female with drug resistant epilepsy had left temporal lobe surgery with retained mesial structures. Upon re-evaluation with video-EEG monitoring, interictal epileptiform discharges and multiple focal seizures localized to the left posterior temporal-parietal region. She subsequently underwent sEEG with 10 electrodes placed in the left hemisphere around prior surgical margins. Electrical stimulation was performed. Bipolar stimulation of deep electrodes (LV 1-2) in the anterior insular cortex at 5 mA, 50 Hz, 500 msec pulse width in trains of 4 seconds an initial "" emotional"" response and "" teary eyed"" signs were present and subjective symptoms of profound sadness. The task of continuous counting was interrupted, and she was unable to finish counting due to the intensity of emotion. Cognitive, motor, language function was normal with intact level of awareness. No post-operative "" lesion"" was present. When the stimulation was stopped, she returned to her normal mental state with recall of the emotion. This was reproducible with intensification upon repeat stimulation. Conclusion(s): Our case is unique in demonstrating transitory profound sadness and pathological crying during presurgical brain mapping for epilepsy. The timesynched temporal effect of stimulation provides strong causal pathophysiological relationship to implicate the anterior insula in the brain biology of pathological crying.",Click here for full text options,,,,

wakefulness","Encephalopathy with continuous spike-waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS) evolves over time, and three stages can be recognized: before the onset of CSWS, during CSWS, and after the CSWS period. Clinical seizures tend to remit spontaneously around puberty. This pattern is independent of the etiological lesion. The CSWS also disappears in all cases. Focal abnormalities instead, may persist for some time after the disappearance of CSWS. The disappearance of the clinical seizures and CSWS may be simultaneous or seizures may disappear before or after disappearance of the CSWS pattern on the EEG. Electroclinical parameters in the pre-CSWS period that have been proposed to predict a poor outcome are early-onset seizures, appearance of new seizures, and a significant increase in seizure frequency. From the electrical point of view, an increase in the frequency of the interictal EEG paroxysms while awake and during sleep and bilateral spike-and-wave paroxysms may also be predictive of a poor evolution in CSWS. When CSWS disappears, neurocognitive and behavioral status improve, but in most patients, residual moderate to severe neurocognitive impairments remain. In non-lesional epilepsy, cognitive recovery after cessation of the CSWS depends on the severity and duration of the initial regression. The duration of the CSWS seems to be the most important predictor of cognitive outcome. Early recognition and effective therapy to reduce the seizures and resolve the CSWS may be crucial to improve long-term prognosis. Cognitive recovery is observed in patients who respond well to AED treatment and outcome depends on the etiology.Copyright © 2019 Epileptic Disorders",Click here for full text options,,,,

SNpr projects to the deep and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (DLSC) and the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), but the contributions of these projections are unknown. To address this gap, we optogenetically silenced cell bodies within SNpr, nigrotectal terminals within DLSC, and nigrotegmental terminals within PPN. Inhibition of cell bodies in SNpr suppressed generalized seizures evoked by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), partial seizures evoked from the forebrain, absence seizures evoked by gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), and audiogenic seizures in genetically epilepsy-prone rats. Strikingly, these effects were fully recapitulated by silencing nigrotectal projections. By contrast, silencing nigrotegmental terminals reduced only absence seizures and exacerbated seizures evoked by PTZ. These data underscore the broad-spectrum anticonvulsant efficacy of this circuit, and demonstrate that specific efferent projection pathways differentially control different seizure types.Copyright © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

temporal bone","Transcranial focal electrical stimulation (TFS) via tripolar concentric ring electrodes (TCRE), tripolar TFS, is proposed to treat pharmacoresistant epilepsy. We determined the effect of tripolar TFS on electrical amygdaloid kindling (AK) in freely moving cats. Fifteen cats were bilaterally implanted with electrodes in the amygdala (AM) and prefrontal cortex and assigned to three groups: the control group, which only received AK; the tripolar TFS before AK group, in which TCREs were placed over the vertex and tripolar TFS (300 Hz, 200 mus biphasic equal charge, square pulses) was delivered for 40 min just prior to AK; and the tripolar TFS after AK group, in which the TCREs were placed over the temporal bone ipsilateral to the kindled AM, while tripolar TFS was administered for 2 min just after AK onset for 40 days, and, thereafter, only AK was applied. AK was applied daily until all animals reached kindling stage VI. A three concentric spheres finite element cat head model was developed to analyze the electric fields caused by tripolar TFS. Tripolar TFS after AK inhibited kindling development. Animals with tripolar TFS after AK remained at the focal seizure stages for 20 days after tripolar TFS cessation and required 80.0 +/- 15.42 AK stimulations to reach stage VI, significantly higher than TFS before AK, and control (P <.001). Tripolar TFS before AK did not show signs of protection against epileptogenesis. The finite modeling of tripolar TFS showed that the electric field is >0.3 mV/mm at depths less than approximately 12.6 mm in the cat brain, which should be strong enough to alter brain activity. In conclusion, tripolar TFS applied via a TCRE over the ipsilateral temporal area significantly delayed AK. This taken together with other reports of tripolar TFS aborting seizures in acute seizure models suggests that tripolar TFS is a promising new modality that should be considered for further testing.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,"*transcranial focal electrical stimulation [other term]

*thermoreceptor","In spite of systematic investigations, the existence of a specific cortex that could encode for the intensities of somatosensory stimuli, including within nociceptive ranges, is still a matter of debate. The present consensus is that pain is expressed in a distributed network made of thalamus, SII, insula, ACC, and, less consistently, SI. Here we argument that there must be an entrance to this network. The common denominator to every functional imaging study is that the subjects can distinguish between noxious and non-noxious stimuli, or between two different intensities of noxious stimuli. This is associated with a consistent activation of the insula-SII cortices while activations in other brain areas may be missing or sub-significant. In other words, the operculo-insular cortex activations are the most robust pain-related activations across studies, whatever the manipulation of the pain components, except the discriminative one. Intra-cerebral recordings also pointed out this piece of cortex as being able to encode for pain intensity. As a last physiological argument, stimulating directly the brain with small intensities standardized electrical shocks elicited pain sensations selectively if the electrode was in the operculo-insular cortex. Human models of disease confirmed that epileptic discharges in the insular cortex can produce ictal pain. Insular epilepsy (or propagation of discharges to the insular cortex)is the only focal epilepsy to be possibly associated with painful symptoms. Finally, unique and focal lesions of the posterior operculo-insular cortices were able to remove (or at least to impair)thermosensory and nociceptive functions. Thus, the operculo-insular area can be presented as the only area in the brain to respond to the features of a primary thermosensory and nociceptive cortex. This area is likely to be the starting point of the nociceptive-related networks. Future investigations are necessary to determine how this ""pain symphony"" between these different brain areas is temporally orchestrated. Developments of new targets for functional neurosurgery could benefit of such localized and initiating processes, for instance focal neurostimulations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Click here for full text options,*opercular cortex [other term],,,

whole cell patch clamp","Focal limbic seizures often impair consciousness/awareness with major negative impact on quality of life. Recent work has shown that limbic seizures depress brainstem arousal systems, including reduced action potential firing in a key node: cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT). In vivo whole-cell recordings have not previously been achieved in PPT, but are used here with the goal of elucidating the mechanisms of reduced PPT cholinergic neuronal activity. An established model of focal limbic seizures was used in rats following brief hippocampal stimulation under light anesthesia. Whole-cell in vivo recordings were obtained from PPT neurons using custom-fabricated 9-10 mm tapered patch pipettes, and cholinergic neurons were identified histologically. Average membrane potential, input resistance, membrane potential fluctuations and variance were analyzed during seizures. A subset of PPT neurons exhibited reduced firing and hyperpolarization during seizures and stained positive for choline acetyltransferase. These PPT neurons showed a mean membrane potential hyperpolarization of -3.82 mV (+/-0.81 SEM, P <.05) during seizures, and also showed significantly increased input resistance, fewer excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP)-like events (P <.05), and reduced membrane potential variance (P <.01). The combination of increased input resistance, decreased EPSP-like events and decreased variance weigh against active ictal inhibition and support withdrawal of excitatory input as the dominant mechanism of decreased activity of cholinergic neurons in the PPT. Further identifying synaptic mechanisms of depressed arousal during seizures may lead to new treatments to improve ictal and postictal cognition.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Methods Retrospective review of clinical records and diagnostic tests. Results The patient had displayedmild focal seizures with sensory and motor symptoms on the left arm and hemiface since the age of 22. Ten years later she experienced abrupt onset of focal left dystonia involving mainly the leg. Brain MRI showed progressive right hemisphere atrophy, and 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18 FDG-PET) showed right hypometabolism mainly over the frontal and insular regions. Brain biopsy confirmed chronic encephalitis. The dystonia became very severe and made walking extremely difficult. Different treatments including dopaminergic, anticholinergic, immunomodulatory drugs and botulinum toxin were ineffective. Finally the patient was treated with unilateral GPi DBS. Shortly after the onset of the stimulation, the dystonia started to improve. Parameters have been adjusted, and 18 months after surgery the patient is able to walk and run unaided, although a mild left leg dystonia persists. Conclusion Rasmussen's disease may be difficult to diagnose in adult patients. Associated movement disorders may be more disabling than seizures. Focal dystonia may be treated successfully with DBS.Copyright © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

The setting of epilepsy surgery, which allows for careful pre- and postsurgical evaluation of patients with cognitive testing and neuroimaging, has produced a wealth of language findings. Moreover, a new wave of surgical interventions, including stereotactic laser ablation and radio frequency ablation, have contributed new insights and corrections to language models as they can make extremely precise, focal lesions. This review covers the common language deficits observed in focal dyscognitive seizure syndromes. It also addresses the effects of surgical interventions on language, and highlights insights gained from unique epilepsy assessment methods (e.g., cortical stimulation mapping, Wada evaluation). Emergent findings are covered including a lack of involvement of the hippocampus in confrontation word retrieval, possible roles for key white matter tracts in language, and the often-overlooked basal temporal language area. The relationship between language and semantic memory networks is also explored, with brief consideration given to the prevailing models of semantic processing, including the amodal Hub and distributed, multi-modal processing models.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

JAMA Neurol. 2019. Importance: Cortical stimulation is used during presurgical epilepsy evaluation for functional mapping and for defining the cortical area responsible for seizure generation. Despite wide use of cortical stimulation, the association between cortical stimulation-induced seizures and surgical outcome remains unknown. Objective(s): To assess whether the removal of the seizure-onset zone resulting from cortical stimulation is associated with a good surgical outcome. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study used data from 2 tertiary epilepsy centers: Montreal Neurological Institute in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Grenoble Alpes University Hospital in Grenoble, France. Participants included consecutive patients (n = 103) with focal drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent stereoelectroencephalography between January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2017. Participant selection criteria were cortical stimulation during implantation, subsequent open surgical procedure with a follow-up of 1 or more years, and complete neuroimaging data sets for superimposition between intracranial electrodes and the resection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cortical stimulation-induced typical electroclinical seizures, the volume of the surgical resection, and the percentage of resected electrode contacts inducing a seizure or encompassing the cortical stimulation-informed and spontaneous seizure-onset zones were identified. These measures were correlated with good (Engel class I) and poor (Engel classes II-IV) surgical outcomes. Electroclinical characteristics associated with cortical stimulation-induced seizures were analyzed. Result(s): In total, 103 patients were included, of whom 54 (52.4%) were female, and the mean (standard deviation) age was 31 (11) years. Fifty-nine (57.3%) patients had cortical stimulation-induced seizures. The percentage of patients with cortical stimulation-induced electroclinical seizures was higher in the good outcome group than in the poor outcome group (31 [70.5%] of 44 vs 28 [47.5%] of 59; P =.02). The percentage of the resected contacts encompassing the cortical stimulation-informed seizure-onset zone correlated with surgical outcome (median [range] percentage in good vs poor outcome: 63.2% [0%-100%] vs 33.3% [0%-84.6%]; Spearman rho = 0.38; P =.003). A similar result was observed for spontaneous seizures (median [range] percentage in good vs poor outcome: 57.1% [0%-100%] vs 32.7% [0%-100%]; Spearman rho = 0.32; P =.002). Longer elapsed time since the most recent seizure was associated with a higher likelihood of inducing seizures (>24 hours: 64.7% vs <24 hours: 27.3%; P =.04). Conclusions and Relevance: Seizure induction by cortical stimulation appears to identify the epileptic generator as reliably as spontaneous seizures do; this finding might lead to a more time-efficient intracranial presurgical investigation of focal epilepsy as the need to record spontaneous seizures is reduced.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Click here for full text options,,electrode,,

Review

seizure

*thalamus anterior nucleus","Purpose of review: Two large-scale controlled clinical trials have provided Class I evidence for the benefit of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a therapy for refractory epilepsy. However, the efficacy has been variable, with some patients not achieving any improvement in their seizure control. This disparity could be the result of suboptimal stimulation parameters/electrodes or alternatively a difference in the type of seizures being treated. This review presents the most recent clinical results with a focus on two major targets for DBS, the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) and the hippocampus. We detail the etiologies where DBS might work best, and provide evidence for the use of recorded neural responses for the optimization of stimulation parameters and closed-loop control of devices. Recent findings: Stimulation of the hippocampus may work well for both focal and generalized seizures, whereas ANT stimulation may be best for focal seizures only. Studies have demonstrated that changes in stimulation-evoked response shape can be used as a biomarker for stimulation efficacy. Furthermore, new biomarkers have been identified that could be used for closed-loop stimulation. Summary: Improvements in patient screening and stimulation optimization are needed for patients to achieve optimal seizure control. Furthermore, therapy should be adjusted to suit individual patient needs. Recording evoked responses during the application of DBS could be used to measure the effectiveness of DBS and titrate stimulation as needed.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Click here for full text options,,,,

It carries high likelihood of unfavourable outcome and putative aetiology relates to an auto-inflammatory process. Standard antiepileptic drug therapies including intravenous anaesthetic agents are largely ineffective in controlling status epilepticus in FIRES. Deep brain stimulation of the centromedian thalamic nuclei (CMN-DBS) has been previously used in refractory status epilepticus in only a few cases. The use of Anakinra (a recombinant version of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) has been reported in one case with FIRES with good outcome. Here we describe two male paediatric patients with FIRES unresponsive to multiple anti-epileptic drugs, first-line immune modulation, ketogenic diet and cannabidiol. They both received Anakinra and underwent CMN-DBS. The primary aim for CMN-DBS therapy was to reduce generalized seizures. CMN-DBS abolished generalized seizures in both cases and Anakinra had a positive effect in one. This patient had a favourable outcome whereas the other did not. These are the first reported cases of FIRES where CMN-DBS has been used.Copyright © 2019",Click here for full text options,"*centromedian thalamic nucleus [other term]

Available medical records, death scene investigation reports, autopsy reports, and next-of-kin interviews were reviewed for all cases of SUDEP. Seizure type, EEG, MRI, and SUDEP classification were adjudicated by 2 epileptologists.ResultsThere were 237 definite and probable cases of SUDEP among 530 NASR participants. SUDEP decedents had a median age of 26 (range 1-70) years at death, and 38% were female. In 143 with sufficient information, 40% had generalized and 60% had focal epilepsy. SUDEP affected the full spectrum of epilepsies, from benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (n = 3, 1%) to intractable epileptic encephalopathies (n = 27, 11%). Most (93%) SUDEPs were unwitnessed; 70% occurred during apparent sleep; and 69% of patients were prone. Only 37% of cases of SUDEP took their last dose of antiseizure medications (ASMs). Reported lifetime generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) were <10 in 33% and 0 in 4%.ConclusionsNASR participants commonly have clinical features that have been previously been associated with SUDEP risk such as young adult age, ASM nonadherence, and frequent GTCS. However, a sizeable minority of SUDEP occurred in patients thought to be treatment responsive or to have benign epilepsies. These results emphasize the importance of SUDEP education across the spectrum of epilepsy severities. We aim to make NASR data and biospecimens available for researchers to advance SUDEP understanding and prevention.Copyright © American Academy of Neurology.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Shortly before his retirement from Harvard University in 1933, Cushing sent Penfield 8 sketches that he drew in 1902 and 1903 while he was at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The first series of 3 sketches illustrate the relationship between a cortical hemorrhagic lesion and the motor strip in a patient with focal motor seizures. The second series also comprises 3 sketches. These depict the operative findings in a patient in whom Cushing had electrically stimulated the precentral gyrus, before resecting the cortex subserving motility of the upper extremity to control painful dyskinetic movements. The third series consists of 2 sketches that illustrate the results of stimulation of the motor strip as an aid in the safe resection of an epileptogenic focus in a patient with Jacksonian seizures. These sketches are the subjects of this paper. They add to the relatively sparse record of Cushing's activities in cortical stimulation and in the treatment of functional disorders.Copyright ©AANS 2019.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Objective(s): To investigate whether electrographic effects of responsive neurostimulation (RNS), identified in electrocorticographic (ECOG) recordings from the device, are associated with patient outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Retrospective review of ECOG recordings and accompanying clinical meta-data from 11 consecutive patients with focal epilepsy who were implanted with a neurostimulation system between January 28, 2015, and June 6, 2017, with 22 to 112 weeks of follow-up. Recorded ECOG data were obtained from the manufacturer; additional system-generated meta-data, including recording and detection settings, were collected directly from the manufacturer's management system using an in-house, custom-built platform. Electrographic seizure patterns were identified in RNS recordings and evaluated in the time-frequency domain, which was locked to the onset of the seizure pattern. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patterns of electrophysiological modulation were identified and then classified according to their latency of onset in relation to triggered stimulation events. Seizure control after RNS implantation was assessed by 3 main variables: mean frequency of seizure occurrence, estimated mean severity of seizures, and mean duration of seizures. Overall seizure outcomes were evaluated by the extended Personal Impact of Epilepsy Scale questionnaires, a patient-reported outcome measure of 3 domains (seizure characteristics, medication adverse effects, and quality of life), with a range of possible scores from 0 to 300 in which lower scores indicate worse status, and the Engel scale, which comprises 4 classes (I-IV) in which lower numbers indicate greater improvement. Result(s): Electrocorticographic data from 11 patients (8 female; mean [range] age, 35 [19-65] years; mean [range] duration of epilepsy, 19 [5-37] years) were analyzed. Two main categories of electrophysiological signatures of stimulation-induced modulation of the seizure network were discovered: direct and indirect effects. Direct effects included ictal inhibition and early frequency modulation but were not associated with improved clinical outcomes (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.06-7.35; P >.99). Only indirect effects - those occurring remote from triggered stimulation - were associated with improved clinical outcomes (OR, infinity; 95% CI, -infinity to infinity; P =.02). These indirect effects included spontaneous ictal inhibition, frequency modulation, fragmentation, and ictal duration modulation. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that RNS effectiveness may be explained by long-term, stimulation-induced modulation of seizure network activity rather than by direct effects on each detected seizure..Copyright © 2019 American Medical Association.

However, there is a significant service gap in integrating these therapies in clinical care. Our epilepsy center has established an epilepsy neuromodulation clinic to improve access to patients, communication with referring physicians, track outcome and train future providers in programming neuromodulation devices. We report the (a) treatment outcome of the available neuromodulation therapies (ie, reduction in seizure frequency over 6-12 months follow-up); and (b) demonstrate the benefit of the specialized clinic (rapid titration, continuity of care, superior access for patient and vendors). In this single-center, retrospective study, forty-three adults (VNS = 27; RNS = 16) with drug-resistant epilepsy were followed in the clinic during the 19 months study period. About 44-69% of patients reported > 60% decrease in seizure. All patients were scheduled in the clinic within 2-4 weeks, and stimulations were optimized rapidly. About 40% of patients participated in research while 28% were referred for additional diagnostic studies. Nineteen students and fellows were trained in programming neurostimulator. Epilepsy neuromodulation clinic can serve as an optimal solution for patients as well as providers due to rapid access, better continuity of care, higher recruitment for research studies, and training health professionals.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

A better understanding of the network mechanisms underlying this fascinating subjective experience may help to unravel some mysteries of human consciousness. Insula has been recently proposed to be a key region to elicit these symptoms. Objective/Hypothesis: We studied functional connectivity changes in several brain areas during the induction of ecstatic auras by direct electrical stimulation of the dorsal anterior insular cortex in patients with refractory focal epilepsy implanted with intracerebral electrodes (stereotactic-EEG, SEEG) in the context of their pre-surgical evaluation. Method(s): Three patients were selected on the basis of the occurrence of ecstatic symptoms triggered by direct intracerebral electrical stimulation (ES) of the antero-dorsal part of the insula. ES was performed (50 Hz, 1.5-2.1 mA, in a bipolar fashion to each contact in the gray matter during a 3 s period) to map functional cortices and trigger habitual seizures. One stimulation inducing ecstatic changes in each patient was analyzed. Functional connectivity analysis was performed by measuring interdependencies (nonlinear regression analysis based on the h2 coefficient) between SEEG signals before and after stimulations. Result(s): In all patients, only the stimulation of dorsal anterior insula was able to reproduce an ecstatic aura. We observed a significant increase of functional connectivity values between several brain regions in the immediate period following stimulations. The most commonly implicated region was the dorsal anterior insula. Out-degrees (a measure intended to identify leading structures in a network) identified the dorsal anterior insula as the most common leading region in the induced networks. Conclusion(s): Our findings bring additional support in favor of a major role played by the dorsal anterior insula in ecstatic experiences.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,cortical electrode,,

Patients were followed for 12 months. The first 6 months were blinded with regard to active stimulation or not. After 6 months, all patients received active stimulation. Material(s) and Method(s): Bilateral ANT electrodes were implanted into 18 patients suffering from focal, pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Antiepileptic treatment was kept unchanged from three months prior to operation. The Liverpool seizure severity scale (LSSS) was used to measure the burden of epilepsy. Result(s): There was no significant difference between the 2 groups at the end of the blinded period at 6 months. However, when considering all patients and comparing 6 months of stimulation with baseline, there was a significant, 22% reduction in the frequency of all seizures (P = 0.009). Four patients had >=50% reduction in total seizure frequency and 5 patients >=50% reduction in focal seizures after 6 months of stimulation. No increased effect over time was shown. LSSS at 6 months compared to baseline showed no significant difference between the 2 groups, but a small, significant reduction in LSSS was found when all patients had received stimulation for 6 months. Conclusion(s): Our study supports results from earlier studies concerning DBS as a safe treatment option, with effects even in patients with severe, refractory epilepsy. However, our results are not as encouraging as those reported from many other, mainly unblinded, and open studies.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We describe a patient who developed a quadrantopsia and drug-resistant focal epilepsy after an arteriovenous malformation hemorrhage. Thirty years later, he underwent placement of subdural electrodes for seizure mapping. Phosphenes were elicited in the blind right visual field with stimulation of occipital cortex. This case demonstrates that visual cortex may retain functional organization after a partial subcortical visual pathway injury. This persistent conscious mapping suggests that disconnected visual cortex could serve as a region for interfacing with neural prosthetic devices for acquired blindness.Copyright © 2019",Click here for full text options,quadrantopsia / complication [other term],"electrode implant

However, the mechanism, the optimal stimulus target, and the optimal stimulation parameters are still unclear. In this study, we used a self-developed micro-neurostimulation system deliver continuous low-frequency (1Hz) electrical stimulation to bilateral endopiriform nuclei (EPN). We want to explore new stimulation targets and parameters that can control focal epilepsy. Materials/Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotactic surgical implanted a segment of cobalt wire (1. 0 mm in diameter and 1. 5 mm in length) into the left motor cortex. Two screw electrodes and two tungsten depth electrodes were symmetrically implanted into the bilateral motor cortex and hippocampal CA1 for EEG recording. Then two bipolar tungsten stimulation electrodes were implanted into bilateral EPN. We stimulated each side of the EPN separately and recorded the evoked potential from the ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 region to confirm the stimulating electrodes were accurately implanted in the EPN. Final stimulus parameters were adjusted to the intensity produced half-maximal evoked. Three days later, video-EEG monitoring and bilateral EPN were stimulated with low frequency (1Hz) sustained stimulus was started. The stimulation was stopped after three consecutive days without seizures. At the end of the experiment, all rats were euthanized, their brains were quickly removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution. After removed the cobalt wire, the whole brain was imaged using 7.0T magnetic resonance. Subsequent histological examination of brain was done to confirm the stimulation and recording electrodes are in the right place. Finally, the EEG was analyzed and compared between the groups, and behavioral seizures were assessed by Racine scale. Result(s): Results show that the average seizures/day in the EPN stimulation group was significantly reduced (3.2+/-0.2/d) compared to the control group (8.1+/-1.0/d, P<0.001) and sham stimulation group (7.6+/-0.8/d, P<0.001). The seizure behavioral score (Racine scale) in the EPN stimulation group was lower (3.0+/-0.2/d) than the control group (4.1+/-0.1/d, P<0.001) and sham stimulation group (4.0+/-0.2/d, P<0.001). EEG spectral analysis showed that the power of theta band of seizures in EPN stimulation group was significantly reduced compared to the control group and sham stimulation group (P<0. 01). Discussion(s): None Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrate that sustained 1 Hz low frequency stimulation of bilateral EPN can reduce the number of seizures and the seizure behavioral score in chronic focal epilepsy in rats, which suggests that EPN may be a potential target for clinical DBS for drug refractory epilepsy.

Deep brain stimulation(DBS) was approved by FDA lately for adult patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). The experience of DBS for children with DRE is limited. In this study, we would like to report two children who had callosotomy and subsequent DBS treatment for more than 4 years. Case report: The first case is a 19-year-old female patient who has seizure onset at the age of 11 after meningoencephalitis. Her seizures were characterized by focal motor seizures with impaired of awareness followed by bilateral tonicclonic seizures. The seizure occurred 3 to 5 times per day and was refractory to medication. The EEG suggested diffuse cortical dysfunction with multifocal epileptogenecity. She received callosotomy when she was 13 years old with limited responses. DBS at bilateral anterior thalami was performed at age of 14. Now she had only brief nocturnal seizures 2 to 5 times per months and reduction of baseline AED dosage. The second case is a 16-year-old male patient, who has seizure onset at 3 years old and intellectual disability. He had daily disabling seizures in spite of 7 different AEDs. Video-EEG showed multiple types of seizures compatible with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Limited response was recorded after receiving callosotomy when he was 12 years old. He then underwent DBS in bilateral anterior thalami half year after the callosotomy. Now he takes three AEDs for seizure control and has 4-6 brief seizures per month. Improvement of cognition was also noted. Conclusion(s): Deep brain stimulation in bilateral anterior thalami could play an ideal treatment in children with drug resistant epilepsy with a previous callosotomy. The long term seizure outcomes are satisfactory in our cases. Prospective registries and future clinical trials are needed to identify the suitable candidates for DBS.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The first DBS operation was performed in 2011 at our center. ANT DBS is recommended in drug resistant focal epilepsy which is not suitable for resective surgery or if the resective surgery and/or VNS was not effective. Method(s): The drug resistant epileptic patients undergo a complete non-invasive presurgical evaluation programme. Epilepsy surgery team provides a consensus statement for the patient about the surgical options. The DBS implantation is carried out in full anaesthesia. Stereotactic T1 MRI is merged with preop plan. We use transventricular, subcaudal or mixed trajectory. We postpone initial programming 4 weeks after operation to use the potential micro-lesion effect (3V,90us,145 Hz). We usually do not change the medication regime. 8 weeks after the implantation, we switch to the following parameters: 5V, 90us, 145 Hz. In the case of not eligible effect we raise voltage to 7/7,5 V gradually. We use always cycling mode: 1 min ON/5 min OFF. Result(s): We have 11 DBS implanted patients with up to 7 years follow up.We experienced significant seizure frequency reduction in case of almost every patient ~ 75% responder rate. We have 1 seizure free patient. Severe/disabling seizures responded better. Daytime seizures were reduced better than seizures at night in the case of frontal lobe epilepsy. We didn't notice device or operation related side effects. Two of them had pregnancy. They didn't have any complication during pregnancy, the babies were born naturally and they are healthy. Conclusion(s): ANT DBS therapy is safe and effective for drug resistant epileptic pateints and seems to be safe for young epileptic women, wo would like to have a child. Therapeutic effect increases with time without changing the DBS parameters!",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): A piece of cobalt wire was implanted into left motor cortex in SD rats to induce chronic epilepsy. Two screw electrodes and two tungsten depth electrodes were implanted into bilateral motor cortex and hippocampus CA1. Two bipolar tungsten stimulation electrodes were stereotactically implanted into bilateral EPN by stimulating each side of EPN separately and recording the evoked potential (EP) in ipsilateral CA1. Three days after surgery, all the rats were subjected to long term video-EEG monitoring and behavioral seizures were assessed by Racine scale. Simultaneously, bilateral EPN nuclei were stimulated with 1 Hz sustained stimulus until three consecutive days without seizures. Result(s): Results show that average number of seizures per day in EPN-DBS group was significantly reduced (3.2 +/- 0.2/d, n = 5) compared with control group (8.1 +/- 1.0/d, n = 5, p < 0.001) and sham stimulation group (7.6 +/- 0.8/d, n = 5, p < 0.001). Seizure behavioral score (Racine scale) in EPN-DBS group was significantly lower (3.0 +/- 0.2/d, n = 5) than control group (4.1 +/- 0.1/d, n = 5, p < 0.001) and sham stimulation group (4.0 +/- 0.2/d, n = 5, p < 0.001). Electroencephalogram spectral analysis showed that the power of theta band of seizures in EPN stimulation group was significantly reduced compared to the control group and sham stimulation group (p < 0. 01). Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrate that sustained 1 Hz low frequency stimulation of bilateral EPN can reduce the number of seizures and the seizure behavioral score in chronic focal epilepsy in rats, which suggests that EPN may be a potential target for clinical DBS for drug refractory epilepsy. In addition, the inhibition of electroencephalogram broadband spectrum power, especially power of theta band, may be the underlying mechanismto control seizures.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Chronic subthreshold cortical stimulation (CSCS) is a brain stimulation technique that lowers seizures probability and offers an alternative therapy to resection or responsive stimulation (Lundstrom et al., 2016). Here, we present expanded clinical results of 21 patients treated with CSCS and relate acute changes in biomarkers during trail stimulation with long-term clinical outcomes. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of 21 patients who have been permanently implanted with a stimulation device for CSCS was performed. Prior to permanent implantation, patients received temporary trial stimulation over a 1-2 day period during their invasive monitoring. EEG biomarkers including spike rate and relative spectral power were assessed before and during trial stimulation. Results were correlated with clinical outcomes, which included seizure frequency as well as subjective rates of epilepsy severity and quality of life. Result(s): Mean follow-up time for the 21 patients was 29 months (range 3-62). 50% of patients were free of disabling seizures in the 3 month period prior to last follow-up. Median seizure reduction was 99% with 89% responder rate. 42% reported a greater than 6-month period of seizure freedom. Stimulation-induced decreases in delta power and increases in beta power were correlated with improved long-term clinical outcome. Conclusion(s): CSCS is an alternative brain stimulation technique for focal DRE when resection is not feasible. Trial stimulation during temporary implantation of invasive EEG electrodes allows electrode location to optimized for permanent implantation. References: Lundstrom, B.

However, in the absence of synaptic transmission, neural activity has been observed to continue to propagate. Several experimental results have shown that propagation of epileptiform activity in rodent hippocampi propagates at a speed of ~0.1 m/s. This observed activity in the 4-AP model propagates independently of synaptic transmission and gap junctions, and is outside the range of ionic diffusion and axonal conduction speeds. Compartment modeling of pyramidal neurons indicate that ephaptic coupling, or endogenous electric fields, could be responsible for this propagation of neural activity in pathological conditions such as epilepsy. Recent studies suggest electric fields can activate neighboring neurons, thereby generating a self-propagating wave. However, there is no experimental data suggesting ephaptic coupling is necessary and sufficient for spontaneous, self-regenerating propagation of neural activity. Using in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology in combination with imaging of trans-membrane voltages using genetically encoded voltage indicators, we test the hypothesis that ephaptic coupling is a critical mechanism for non-synaptic neural propagation. We have developed a novel extracellular electric field clamp capable of measuring the endogenous field and generate an ""anti"" field to block non-synaptic spontaneous propagation in the rodent hippocampus (Figure 1A). By blocking propagation, we are able to show that ephaptic coupling is a necessary mechanism for propagation of spontaneous activity. Finally, since electric fields propagate as volume conductors, we test if activity can propagate through a complete physical cut of the tissue, thereby eliminating all other forms of close cell-to-cell communication and showing that electric fields alone are sufficient to mediate non-synaptic propagation. Preliminary results suggest that spontaneous epileptiform activity propagates by triggering the activity on the other side across the cut with ephaptic coupling without changing the speed (Figure 1B). Our findings suggest that ephaptic coupling is necessary and sufficient to mediate non-synaptic neural propagation. Further investigation of this mechanism could explain how focal seizures appear to start abruptly and unpredictably, and how the rare micro-seizures of human partial epilepsy (seizure-like events that are not clinically detectable and are resistant to most common antiepileptic drugs) propagate through the hippocampus and cortex. Furthermore, endogenous electric fields could play an important role in brain function and could provide an explanation for unresolved mechanisms of deep brain stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).Copyright © 2018",Click here for full text options,conference abstract [other term],,,

vagus nerve stimulation","Focal epilepsies represent approximately half of all diagnoses, and more than one-third of these patients are refractory to pharmacologic treatment. Although resection can result in seizure freedom, many patients do not meet surgical criteria, as seizures may be multifocal in origin or have a focus in an eloquent region of the brain. For these individuals, several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved electrical stimulation paradigms serve as alternative options, including vagus nerve stimulation, responsive neurostimulation, and stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. All of these are safe, flexible, and lead to progressive seizure control over time when used as an adjunctive therapy to antiepileptic drugs. Focal epilepsies frequently involve significant comorbidities such as cognitive decline. Similar to antiepilepsy medications and surgical resection, current stimulation targets and parameters have yet to address cognitive impairments directly, with patients reporting persistent comorbidities associated with focal epilepsy despite a significant reduction in the number of their seizures. Although low-frequency theta oscillations of the septohippocampal network are critical for modulating cellular activity and, in turn, cognitive processing, the coordination of neural excitability is also imperative for preventing seizures. In this review, we summarize current FDA-approved electrical stimulation paradigms and propose that theta oscillations of the medial septal nucleus represent a novel neuromodulation target for concurrent seizure reduction and cognitive improvement in epilepsy. Ultimately, further advancements in clinical neurostimulation strategies will allow for the efficient treatment of both seizures and comorbidities, thereby improving overall quality of life for patients with epilepsy.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

young adult","The running-down phenomenon refers to 2 analogous but distinct entities that may be seen after epilepsy surgery. The first is clinical, and denotes a progressive diminution in seizures after epilepsy surgery in which the epileptogenic zone could not be completely removed (Modern Problems of Psychopharmacology 1970;4:306, Brain 1996:989). The second is electrographic, and refers to a progressive deactivation of a secondary seizure focus after removal of the primary epileptogenic zone. This progressive decrease in epileptiform activity may represent a reversal of secondary epileptogenesis, where a primary epileptogenic zone is postulated to activate epileptiform discharges at a second site and may become independent.3 The electrographic running-down phenomenon has been reported in only limited numbers of patients, using serial postoperative routine scalp electroencephalography (EEG) (Arch Neurol 1985;42:318). We present what is, to our knowledge, the most detailed demonstration of the electrographic running-down phenomenon in humans, made possible by chronic electrocorticography (ECoG). Our patient's left temporal seizure focus overlapped with language areas, limiting the resection to a portion of the epileptogenic zone, followed by implantation of a direct brain-responsive neurostimulator (RNS System, NeuroPace Inc.) to treat residual epileptogenic tissue. Despite the limited extent of the resection, the patient remains seizure-free more than 2 years after surgery, with the RNS System recording ECoG without delivering stimulation. We reviewed the chronic recordings with automated spike detection and inspection of electrographic episodes marked by the neurostimulator. These recordings demonstrate progressive diminution in spiking and rhythmic discharges, consistent with an electrographic running-down phenomenon.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

temporal lobe epilepsy / etiology / therapy","Epilepsy is a network disorder and each type of seizure involves distinct cortical and subcortical network, differently implicated in the control and propagation of the ictal activity. The role of the basal ganglia has been revealed in several cases of focal and generalized seizures. Here, we review the data that show the implication of the basal ganglia in absence, temporal lobe, and neocortical seizures in animal models (rodent, cat, and non-human primate) and in human. Based on these results and the advancement of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, basal ganglia neuromodulation has been tested with some success that can be equally seen as promising or disappointing. The effect of deep brain stimulation can be considered promising with a 76% in seizure reduction in temporal lobe epilepsy patients, but also disappointing, since only few patients have become seizure free and the antiepileptic effects have been highly variable among patients. This variability could probably be explained by the heterogeneity among the patients included in these clinical studies. To illustrate the importance of specific network identification, electrophysiological activity of the putamen and caudate nucleus has been recorded during penicillin-induced pre-frontal and motor seizures in one monkey. While an increase of the firing rate was found in putamen and caudate nucleus during pre-frontal seizures, only the activity of the putamen cells was increased during motor seizures. These preliminary results demonstrate the implication of the basal ganglia in two types of neocortical seizures and the necessity of studying the network to identify the important nodes implicated in the propagation and control of each type of seizure.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",Click here for full text options,"focal neocortical epilepsy / etiology / therapy [other term]

Methods We administered 272 instances of DCS at 172 OFC sites in 22 patients with intractable focal epilepsy (from 2011 to 2017), none of whom had seizures originating from the OFC. Results Our observations revealed a rich variety of affective, olfactory, gustatory, and somatosensory changes in the subjective domain. Elicited experiences were largely neutral or negatively valenced (e.g., aversive smells and tastes, sadness, and anger). Evidence was found for preferential left lateralization of negatively valenced experiences and strong right lateralization of neutral effects. Moreover, most of the elicited effects were observed after stimulation of OFC tissue around the transverse orbital sulcus, and none were seen in the most anterior aspects of the OFC. Conclusions Our study yielded 3 central findings: first, a dissociation between the ""silent"" anterior and nonsilent middle/posterior OFC where stimulation clearly elicits changes in subjective experience; second, evidence that the OFC might play a causal role in integrating affect and multimodal sensory experiences; and third, clear evidence for left lateralization of negatively valenced effects. Our findings provide important information for clinicians treating OFC injury or planning OFC resection and scientists seeking to understand the brain basis for the integration of sensation, cognition, and affect.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Neurology.",Click here for full text options,*direct cortical stimulation [other term],cortical electrode,,

Review

therapy effect","In this review, we consider how the piriform cortex is engaged in both focal and generalized epilepsy networks and postulate the various neural pathways that can be effectively neuromodulated by stimulation at this site. This highlights the common involvement of the piriform cortex in epilepsy. We address both current and future preclinical studies of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the piriform cortex, with attention to the critical features of these trials that will enable them to be of greatest utility in informing clinical translation. Although recent DBS trials have utilized thalamic targets, electrical stimulation of the piriform cortex may also be a useful intervention for people with epilepsy. However, more work is required to develop a solid foundation for this approach before considering human trials.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

thalamus anterior nucleus","The efficacy and safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) for epilepsy (SANTE) trial was demonstrated by a randomized trial by Fisher et al. (2010). Based on this trial, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently granted approval for DBS therapy for epilepsy; the indication is as follows: ""Bilateral stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) for epilepsy is indicated as an adjunctive therapy for reducing the frequency of seizures in individuals 18 years of age or older diagnosed with epilepsy characterized by partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization that are refractory to three or more antiepileptic medications"". This paper reviews the experimental data and the clinical experience using DBS for the treatment of epilepsy.

We describe results of chronic bilateral ANT stimulation and bilateral ANT lesions in 31 patients with refractory epilepsy. Method(s): ANT DBS was performed in 12 patients (group I) and bilateral stereotactic radiofrequency lesions of ANT were performed in 19 patients (group II). Targeting was based on stereotactic atlas information with correction of the final coordinates according to the location of anatomical landmarks and intraoperative microelectrode recording data. Result(s): Both groups were similar in age, gender, seizures frequency, and duration of disease. The median x, y, and z coordinates of ANT were found to be 2.9, 5, and 11 mm anterior, lateral, and superior to the mid-commissural point, respectively. Mean seizures reduction reached 80.3% in group of patients with ANT DBS with two nonresponders and 91.2% in group of patients with lesions. Five patients from group I and three patients from group II became seizure-free. The morbidity rate was low in both groups. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic anterior thalamotomy and chronic ANT stimulation are both effective for seizure control in epilepsy originated from frontal and temporal lobes. ANT lesions and stimulation were more effective for secondary-generalized seizures compared to simple partial seizures.Copyright © 2018 Surgical Neurology International Published by Wolters Kluwer Medknow.",Click here for full text options,,"microelectrode

univariate analysis","Introduction: Stimulation-evoked focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (FBTCS) can be a stressful and possibly harmful adverse event for patients during cortical stimulation (CS). We evaluated if drug load reduction of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during CS increases the risk of stimulation-evoked FBTCS. Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective cohort study, we searched our local database for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent invasive video-EEG monitoring and CS in the University Hospital la Fe Valencia from January 2006 to November 2016. The AED drug load was calculated with the defined daily dose. We applied a uni- and multivariate logistic regression model to estimate the risk of stimulation-evoked FBTCS and evaluate possible influencing factors. Furthermore, we compared patients whose AEDs were completely withdrawn with those whose AEDs were not. Result(s): Fifty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Stimulating 3806 electrode contact pairs, 152 seizures were evoked in 28 patients (48.3%). Ten seizures (6.6%) in seven patients (12.1%) evolved to FBTCS. In the univariate and multivariate analysis, a 10% reduction in drug load was associated with an increase of the odds ratio (OR) of stimulation-evoked FBTCS by 1.9 (95%-CI 1.2, 4.0, p-value = 0.04) and 1.9 (95%-CI 1.2, 4.6, p-value = 0.04), respectively. In patients, whose AEDs were completely withdrawn the OR of FBTCS increased by 9.1 (95%CI 1.7, 69.9, p-value = 0.01) compared with patients whose AEDs were not completely withdrawn. No other factor (implantation type, maximum stimulus intensity, number of stimulated contacts, history of FBTCS, age, gender, or epilepsy type) appears to have a significant effect on the risk of stimulation-evoked FBTCS. Conclusion(s): The overall risk of stimulation-evoked FBTCS during CS is relatively low. However, a stronger reduction and, especially, a complete withdrawal of AEDs are associated with an increased risk of stimulation-evoked FBTCS.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,"*focal to bilateral tonic clonic seizure / *complication / *side effect [other term]

Electrical stimulation mapping remains an important part of the surgical evaluation process in SEEG, as it is in subdural electrocorticography cases. Because the technique and electrodes used in SEEG and electrocorticography are distinct, the clinician needs to be aware of the important differences between these techniques when performing electrical stimulation mapping. In this review, the advantages, disadvantages, and potential safety concerns related to electrical stimulation mapping in SEEG are discussed. A case is presented illustrating the utility of SEEG cortical stimulation and safety concerns that need to be considered when performing these evaluations.Copyright © 2018 by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society.",Click here for full text options,,"electroencephalograph electrode

The number of double-blinded RCTs demonstrating the efficacy of neurostimulation in persons with epilepsy is increasing. Although reductions in seizure frequency is common in these trials, obtaining seizure freedom is rare. Invasive neuromodulation procedures (DBS, VNS, and RNS) have been approved as therapeutic measures. However, further investigations are necessary to delineate effective targeting, minimize side effects that are related to chronic implantation and to improve the cost effectiveness of these devices. The RCTs of non-invasive modes of neuromodulation whilst showing much promise (tDCS, eTNS, rTMS), require larger powered studies as well as studies that focus at better targeting techniques. We provide a review of double-blinded randomized clinical trials that have been conducted for neuromodulation in epilepsy.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior thalamic nucleus (ANT) has been used for the treatment of refractory partial seizures. In the pilocarpine model of epilepsy, ANT DBS applied during status epilepticus (SE) reduces hippocampal inflammation and apoptosis. When given to chronic epileptic animals it reduces hippocampal excitability and seizure frequency. Here, we tested whether ANT DBS delivered during SE and the silent phase of the pilocarpine model would reduce cognitive impairment when animals became chronically epileptic. Material(s) and Method(s): SE was induced by a systemic pilocarpine injection (320 mg/kg). Immediately after SE onset, rats were assigned to receive DBS during the first six hours of SE (n = 8; DBSa group) or during SE + the silent period (i.e., 6 h/day until the animals developed the first spontaneous recurrent seizure; n = 10; DBSs group). Four months following SE, animals underwent water maze testing and histological evaluation. Nonstimulated chronic epileptic animals (n = 13; PCTL group) and age-matched naive rats (n = 11, CTL group) were used as controls. Results were analyzed by repeated-measures analyses of variance (RM_ANOVA) and one-way ANOVAs, followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. Result(s): Although all groups learned the spatial task, epileptic animals with or without DBS spent significantly less time in the platform quadrant, denoting a spatial memory deficit (p < 0.02). Despite these negative behavioral results, we found that animals given DBS had a significantly higher number of cells in the CA1 region and dentate gyrus. Mossy fiber sprouting was similar among all epileptic groups. Conclusion(s): Despite lesser hippocampal neuronal loss, ANT DBS delivered either during SE or during SE and the silent phase of the pilocarpine model did not mitigate memory deficits in chronic epileptic rats.Copyright © 2017 International Neuromodulation Society",Click here for full text options,,,,

thalamus anterior nucleus","Objective: To describe a rare case of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) masking seizure in a Parkinson's Disease (PD) patient. Background(s): Not applicable. Design/Methods: A case report. Result(s): A 77 year old caucasian female with PD receives a DBS targeting bilateral GPi nuclei with activation of the right lead only. She has no history of seizure. Approximately one year after DBS placement she is admitted for treatment of acute onset Bipolar mania. During her hospital stay, she becomes catatonic with rare episodes of left head turning and rigidity. The initial EEG shows a diffuse 60 hertz artifact. The DBS is turned off due to concern for possible behavioral side effects after which EEG reveals multiple right focal seizures with secondary generalization. A brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan shows hypermetabolic activity surrounding the right DBS lead and ipsilateral frontal cortex. Despite multiple anti-epileptic drug (AED) trials, it is not until the DBS is turned back on that the seizures are controlled. The patient reports at the time of follow up she is non-compliant with AEDs. She is exclusively maintained on right lead DBS activation. No further seizure activity is reported. Conclusion(s): Deep brain stimulation for the management of intractable epilepsy has acquired extensive attention recently for its results targeting different areas of the brain. Trials targeting the hippocampus and cortex by responsive neural stimulation (RNS) and DBS targeting the anterior nucleus of the thalamus have shown notable success. Among the targets investigated, the basal ganglia has yet to be extensively studied outside of animal models. This case is a novel example of successful seizure suppression in a patient with GPi lead placement.

This study examined incidence of memory and depression adverse events (AE) in the SANTE study blinded phase and their relationship to objective neurobehavioral measures, baseline characteristics, quality of life and long-term neurobehavioral outcome. Method The neurobehavioral AE and neuropsychological data from a previously reported prospective randomized trial (SANTE) were analyzed. Reliable change indices (RCI) were calculated for memory and mood measures. Analyses examined relationships among AEs, RCIs, demographic and seizure variables, and long-term neurobehavioral outcome. Results No significant cognitive declines or worsening of depression scores were observed through the blinded phase or in open-label at 7-years. Higher scores were observed at 7 years on measures of executive functions and attention. Depression and memory-related AEs were not associated with reliable change on objective measures or 7-year neurobehavioral outcome. The AEs were without significant impact on life quality. Memory and depression AEs were not related to demographic or seizure characteristics, change in seizure frequency, frequency of AE or depression report. Conclusion Bilateral ANT DBS was associated with subjective depression and memory AEs during the blinded phase in a minority of patients that were not accompanied by objective, long-term neurobehavioral worsening. Monitoring and neuropsychological assessment of depression and memory are recommended from a theoretical standpoint and because more memory and depression AEs occurred in the active stimulation than control group.Copyright © 2016 British Epilepsy Association",Click here for full text options,"Brief Visuospatial Memory Test [other term]

vagus nerve stimulation","Approximately 60% of all patients with epilepsy suffer from focal epilepsy syndromes. In approximately 15% of these patients, the seizures are not adequately controlled with anticonvulsive drugs, and such patients are potential candidates for surgical treatment and majority are children. Epilepsy surgery in children, who have been carefully chosen, can result in either seizure freedom or a marked (>90%) reduction in seizures in approximately two-Third of children with intractable seizures. In the multimodality presurgical evaluation approach, sufficient concordance should be established among various independent investigations, thus identifying the location and extent of the epileptogenic zone with a high degree of confidence. Early surgery improves the quality of life and cognitive and developmental outcome of the child. Surgically remediable epilepsies in children should be identified early and include temporal lobe epilepsy with focal lesions, lesional extratemporal epilepsies, hemispherical epilepsies, and gelastic epilepsy with hypothalamic hamartoma, and can be treated by resective or disconnection surgery. Palliative procedures include corpus callosotomy and vagal nerve stimulation for children with diffuse and multifocal epilepsies, who are not candidates for resective surgery. Deep brain stimulation in patients with epilepsy is still under evaluation. For children with 'surgically remedial epilepsy,' surgery should be offered as a procedure of choice rather than as a treatment of last resort.Copyright © 2017 Neurology India, Neurological Society of India.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Surgery to remove the epileptogenic zone remains the most efficacious treatment option for focal drug-resistant epilepsy. However, when cortical areas are eloquent or there are multiple epileptogenic zones, surgical resection is not an ideal approach. Cortical stimulation provides an attractive alternative. Area covered: Here, the authors describe Chronic Subthreshold Cortical Stimulation (CSCS), which uses continuous intracranial electrical stimulation applied near the epileptogenic zone to lower seizure probability. The authors review literature related to CSCS. One challenge is finding the most efficacious set of stimulation parameters for each patient. Expert commentary: Data supporting CSCS are limited but promising for the treatment of patients with focal drug resistant epilepsy who are not surgical candidates. Additional electrophysiological biomarkers to estimate cortical excitability are needed.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Recent studies in nonhuman primates have shown that motor control and sensory feedback can be achieved by connecting sensors in a robotic arm to electrodes implanted in the brain. However, it remains unknown whether electrical brain stimulationcanbeusedtocreateasenseofownershipofanartificiallimb. In this study on two human subjects, we show that ownership of an artificial hand can be induced via the electrical stimulation of the hand section of the somatosensory (SI) cortex in synchrony with touches applied to a rubber hand. Importantly, the illusion was not elicited when the electrical stimulation was delivered asynchronously or to a portion of the SI cortex representing a body part other than the hand, suggesting that multisensory integration according to basic spatial and temporal congruence rules is the underlying mechanism of the illusion. These findings show that the brain is capable of integrating ""natural"" visual input and direct cortical-somatosensory stimulation to create the multisensory perception that an artificial limb belongs to one's own body. Thus, they serve as a proof of concept that electrical brain stimulation can be used to ""bypass"" the peripheral nervous system to induce multisensory illusions and ownership of artificial body parts, which has important implications for patients who lack peripheral sensory input due to spinal cord or nerve lesions.",Click here for full text options,,,,

To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of ATN DBS treatment, as well as predictors of its success, in patients with drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE). Method We retrospectively studied clinical outcomes in 29 consecutive refractory epilepsy patients treated by a single DBS team (two neurosurgeons, four neurologists) over an 11-year period, for whom follow-up was performed for up to 137 months (mean, 74.9 months). Results The average participant was 30.7 (+/-10.4) years old and had epilepsy for 19.3 (+/-9.0) years. The mean preoperative frequency of disabling partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures was 27.5 (+/-8.6, SE) seizures a month. The median percent seizure reduction was 71.3% at 1 year, 73.9% at 2 years, and ranged from 61.8% to 80.0% over post-implant years 3 through 11 in the long-term study (overall 70% median reduction). In the 11-year study period, 13.8% (4/29) of subjects were seizure-free for at least 12 months during this time. There was only one symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage that happened during follow-up (3.4%). Infection requiring removal and later re-implantation of hardware occurred in only 1 of 30 patients (3.3%), who was subsequently excluded from our follow-up assessment. Hardware malfunction including lead disconnection occurred in 2 of 29 cases (6.9%). Revision of lead position to redeem poor clinical response was performed in 3 of 58 implanted leads (5.2%). Conclusions ATN DBS can be an effective therapy in a variety of patients with DRE. Importantly, we provide evidence that significant therapeutic efficacy can be sustained for up to 11 years. Neurological complications were rather rare, but long-term hardware-related complications should be followed arrectis auribus.Copyright © 2017 British Epilepsy Association",Click here for full text options,"hardware malfunction / complication [other term]

three dimensional imaging","Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is a method for invasive study of patients with refractory epilepsy. Localization of the epileptogenic zone in SEEG relied on the hypothesis of anatomo-electro-clinical analysis limited by X-ray, analog electroencephalography (EEG), and seizure semiology in the 1950s. Modern neuroimaging studies and digital video-EEG have developed the hypothesis aiming at more precise localization of the epileptic network. Certain clinical scenarios favor SEEG over subdural EEG (SDEEG). SEEG can cover extensive areas of bilateral hemispheres with highly accurate sampling from sulcal areas and deep brain structures. A hybrid technique of SEEG and subdural strip electrode placement has been reported to overcome the SEEG limitations of poor functional mapping. Technological advances including acquisition of three-dimensional angiography and magnetic resonance image (MRI) in frameless conditions, advanced multimodal planning, and robot-assisted implantation have contributed to the accuracy and safety of electrode implantation in a simplified fashion. A recent meta-analysis of the safety of SEEG concluded the low value of the pooled prevalence for all complications. The complications of SEEG were significantly less than those of SDEEG. The removal of electrodes for SEEG was much simpler than for SDEEG and allowed sufficient time for data analysis, discussion, and consensus for both patients and physicians before the proceeding treatment. Furthermore, SEEG is applicable as a therapeutic alternative for deep-seated lesions, e.g., nodular heterotopia, in nonoperative epilepsies using SEEG-guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation. We review the SEEG method with technological advances for planning and implantation of electrodes. We highlight the indication and efficacy, advantages and disadvantages of SEEG compared with SDEEG.Copyright © 2017 Japan Neurosurgical Society.

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Objective: To compare motor and nonmotor outcomes at 6 months of asleep deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD) using intraoperative imaging guidance to confirm electrode placement vs awake DBS using microelectrode recording to confirm electrode placement. Method(s): DBS candidates with PD referred to Oregon Health & Science University underwent asleep DBS with imaging guidance. Six-month outcomes were compared to those of patients who previously underwent awake DBS by the same surgeon and center. Assessments included an ""off""-levodopa Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II and III, the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, motor diaries, and speech fluency. Result(s): Thirty participants underwent asleep DBS and 39 underwent awake DBS. No difference was observed in improvement of UPDRS III (+14.8 +/- 8.9 vs +17.6 +/- 12.3 points, p = 0.19) or UPDRS II (19.3 +/- 2.7 vs +7.4 +/- 5.8 points, p = 0.16). Improvement in ""on"" time without dyskinesia was superior in asleep DBS (+6.4 +/- 3.0 h/d vs +1.7 +/- 1.2 h/d, p = 0.002). Quality of life scores improved in both groups (+18.8 +/- 9.4 in awake, +8.9 +/- 11.5 in asleep). Improvement in summary index (p = 0.004) and subscores for cognition (p = 0.011) and communication (p < 0.001) were superior in asleep DBS. Speech outcomes were superior in asleep DBS, both in category (+2.77 +/- 4.3 points vs -6.31 +/- 9.7 points (p = 0.0012) and phonemic fluency (+1.0 +/- 8.2 points vs -5.5 +/- 9.6 points, p = 0.038). Conclusion(s): Asleep DBS for PD improved motor outcomes over 6 months on par with or better than awake DBS, was superior with regard to speech fluency and quality of life, and should be an option considered for all patients who are candidates for this treatment.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.",Click here for full text options,"39 Item Parkinson Disease Questionnaire [other term]

Our aim was to use intracerebral electrical stimulation to specifically compare left and right VTC in naming. In twenty-three epileptic patients tested for visual object naming during stimulation, the proportion of naming impairments was significantly higher in the left than in the right VTC (31.3% vs 13.6%). The highest proportions of positive naming sites were found in the left fusiform gyrus and occipito-temporal sulcus (47.5% and 31.8%). For 17 positive left naming sites, an additional semantic picture matching was carried out, always successfully performed. Our results showed the enhanced role of the left compared to the right VTC in naming and suggest that it may be involved in lexical retrieval rather than in semantic processing.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,"*object naming [other term]

Nevertheless, complications may arise during DBS procedures or following implantation due to implanted hardware. This may result in both minor and major adverse events that may necessitate hardware removal and/or compromise maximal therapeutic benefit for the patient. Objectives and methods To identify relevant literature on hardware-related complications from DBS procedures by performing a systematic review, and propose how to identify at-risk group and possible preventive approaches. Results Of 4592 abstract screened, 96 articles fulfilled the selection criteria and were reviewed. Overall, the most common hardware-related complications were infections (5.12% of patients), followed by lead migration (1.60%), fracture or failure of the lead or other parts of the implant (1.46% and 0.73%, respectively), IPG malfunctions (1.06% of patients), and skin erosions without infections (0.48% of patients). New indications for DBS, including Tourette's syndrome, cluster headache, and refractory partial epilepsy, were found to bear a higher incidence of hardware-related infections than established indications such as Parkinson's disease. The highest rate of lead fracture or failure was found in dystonia patients (4.22%). Ultimately, the highest rate of pain at the implantation sites was found in refractory partial epilepsy patients (16.55%). Conclusion Our analysis identified a variety of potential hardware-related complications among patients who underwent DBS procedures. Patients who were at risk of complications, such as patients with dystonia and off-label indications (e.g. Tourette's syndrome) should be informed prior to surgery and closely followed thereafter.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,*implant / *adverse device effect,,

vasodilatation","Exact protocols for the treatment of status epilepticus (SE) in the ICU particularly if refractory to the initial interventions differ between centers. However, most agree on some basic principles and the initial management approach. Treatment of SE should be initiated as early as possible as delayed treatment will make seizures more difficult to control and clinical outcomes will be worse. Initial treatment should not be underdosed and most would treat nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) the same as convulsive status epilepticus (CSE). Most SE in the ICU is indeed not associated with convulsions and classified as NCSE. Therefore, continuous EEG monitoring should be mandatory, when treating status in the ICU as seizures may otherwise go undetected and as prolonged CSE will convert to NCSE. Several medications are available for treating seizures, but only few are available for parenteral, fast administration when treating status. The experience from using the newer antiepileptics in case of resistant status is therefore limited. Interactions between antiepileptics and common ICU medications may be significant and concurrent multi-organ failure may alter their metabolism.Copyright © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Click here for full text options,,transcranial doppler,,

This study investigated the distribution and networks of the BTLA using a combination of electric cortical stimulation and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Method 10 patients with intractable focal epilepsy who underwent presurgical evaluation with subdural electrodes were enrolled in this study (language dominant side: 6 patients, language nondominant side: 4 patients). Electric stimulation at 50 Hz was applied to the electrodes during Japanese sentence reading, morphograms (kanji) reading, and syllabograms (kana) reading tasks to identify the BTLA. DTI was used to identify the subcortical fibers originating from the BTLA found by electric stimulation. Results The BTLA was found in 6 patients who underwent implantation of the subdural electrodes in the dominant hemisphere. The BTLA was located anywhere between 20 mm and 56 mm posterior to the temporal tips. In 3 patients, electric stimulation of some or all areas within the BTLA induced disturbance in reading of kanji words only. DTI detected the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) in all patients and the uncinate fasciculus (UF) in 1 patient, originating from the BTLA. ILF was detected from both kanji-specific areas and kanji-nonspecific areas. Conclusion This study indicates that the network of the BTLA is a part of a ventral stream and is mainly composed of the ILF, which acts as a critical structure for lexical retrieval. ILF is also associated with the specific processing of kanji words.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,"*basal temporal language area [other term]

Evidence suggests an association between aggression and epilepsy that involves various neurophysiological and neurochemical disturbances. Anti-epileptics have variable effects on behaviour and cognition that need consideration. Early detection and careful consideration of history, symptomatology and possible common comorbid psychiatric disorders is essential. Appropriate investigations should be considered to aid diagnosis, including electroencephalogram (EEG), video EEG telemetry and brain imaging. Optimising treatment of epilepsy, treatment of psychiatric comorbidities and behavioural management can have a major positive effect on patients' recovery and well-being.Copyright © The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2017.",Click here for full text options,,,,

vagus nerve stimulation","Objective: Evaluate the seizure-reduction response and safety of mesial temporal lobe (MTL) brain-responsive stimulation in adults with medically intractable partial-onset seizures of mesial temporal lobe origin. Method(s): Subjects with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) were identified from prospective clinical trials of a brain-responsive neurostimulator (RNS System, NeuroPace). The seizure reduction over years 2-6 postimplantation was calculated by assessing the seizure frequency compared to a preimplantation baseline. Safety was assessed based on reported adverse events. Result(s): There were 111 subjects with MTLE; 72% of subjects had bilateral MTL onsets and 28% had unilateral onsets. Subjects had one to four leads placed; only two leads could be connected to the device. Seventy-six subjects had depth leads only, 29 had both depth and strip leads, and 6 had only strip leads. The mean follow-up was 6.1 +/- (standard deviation) 2.2 years. The median percent seizure reduction was 70% (last observation carried forward). Twenty-nine percent of subjects experienced at least one seizure-free period of 6 months or longer, and 15% experienced at least one seizure-free period of 1 year or longer. There was no difference in seizure reduction in subjects with and without mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), bilateral MTL onsets, prior resection, prior intracranial monitoring, and prior vagus nerve stimulation. In addition, seizure reduction was not dependent on the location of depth leads relative to the hippocampus. The most frequent serious device-related adverse event was soft tissue implant-site infection (overall rate, including events categorized as device-related, uncertain, or not device-related: 0.03 per implant year, which is not greater than with other neurostimulation devices). Significance: Brain-responsive stimulation represents a safe and effective treatment option for patients with medically intractable epilepsy, including patients with unilateral or bilateral MTLE who are not candidates for temporal lobectomy or who have failed a prior MTL resection.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

tonic clonic seizure","Background Deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS) is effective in seizure control. However, the mechanisms remain unclear. Methods Sixty-four rats were randomly assigned to the control group, the kainic acid (KA) group, the sham-DBS group and the DBS group. Video-electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to monitor seizures. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was applied for detecting interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), IL-6, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), gp130, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-receptor 1 (TNF-R1) and TNF-receptor 2 (TNF-R2) expression 12 h after the establishment of an epileptic model. The neuronal structural degeneration in the hippocampus was evaluated with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at this same time point. Results The seizure frequency was 48.6% lower in the DBS group compared with the sham-DBS group (P < 0.01). The expression of IL-1beta, IL-1R, IL-6, IL-6R, gp130, TNF-alpha and TNF-R1 was elevated in both the KA and the sham group compared with the control group (all Ps < 0.01). Additionally, ANT-DBS was able to reverse this gene expression pattern in the DBS group compared with the sham-DBS group (all Ps < 0.01). There was no significant difference in TNF-R2 expression among the four groups. The neuronal structural degeneration in the KA group and the sham-DBS group was more severe than that in the control group (injury scores, all Ps < 0.01). ANT-DBS was also capable of relieving the degeneration compared with the sham-DBS group (injury score, P < 0.01). Conclusions This study demonstrated that ANT-DBS can reduce seizure frequency in the early stage in epileptic rats as well as relieve the pro-inflammatory state and neuronal injury, which may be one of the most effective mechanisms of ANT-DBS against epileptogenesis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Click here for full text options,,,,

three dimensional imaging","We have provided 3-D and 4D mapping of speech and language function based upon the results of direct cortical stimulation and event-related modulation of electrocorticography signals. Patients estimated to have right-hemispheric language dominance were excluded. Thus, 100 patients who underwent two-stage epilepsy surgery with chronic electrocorticography recording were studied. An older group consisted of 84 patients at least 10 years of age (7367 artefact-free non-epileptic electrodes), whereas a younger group included 16 children younger than age 10 (1438 electrodes). The probability of symptoms transiently induced by electrical stimulation was delineated on a 3D average surface image. The electrocorticography amplitude changes of high-gamma (70- 110 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) activities during an auditory-naming task were animated on the average surface image in a 4D manner. Thereby, high-gamma augmentation and beta attenuation were treated as summary measures of cortical activation. Stimulation data indicated the causal relationship between (i) superior-temporal gyrus of either hemisphere and auditory hallucination; (ii) left superior-/middle-temporal gyri and receptive aphasia; (iii) widespread temporal/frontal lobe regions of the left hemisphere and expressive aphasia; and (iv) bilateral precentral/left posterior superior-frontal regions and speech arrest. On electrocorticography analysis, high-gamma augmentation involved the bilateral superior-temporal and precentral gyri immediately following question onset; at the same time, high-gamma activity was attenuated in the left orbitofrontal gyrus. High-gamma activity was augmented in the left temporal/frontal lobe regions, as well as left inferior-parietal and cingulate regions, maximally around question offset, with high-gamma augmentation in the left pars orbitalis inferior-frontal, middle-frontal, and inferiorparietal regions preceded by high-gamma attenuation in the contralateral homotopic regions. Immediately before verbal response, high-gamma augmentation involved the posterior superior-frontal and pre/postcentral regions, bilaterally. Beta-attenuation was spatially and temporally correlated with high-gamma augmentation in general but with exceptions. The younger and older groups shared similar spatial-temporal profiles of high-gamma and beta modulation; except, the younger group failed to show left-dominant activation in the rostral middle-frontal and pars orbitalis inferior-frontal regions around stimulus offset. The human brain may rapidly and alternately activate and deactivate cortical areas advantageous or obtrusive to function directed toward speech and language at a given moment. Increased left-dominant activation in the anterior frontal structures in the older age group may reflect developmental consolidation of the language system. The results of our functional mapping may be useful in predicting, across not only space but also time and patient age, sites specific to language function for presurgical evaluation of focal epilepsy.Copyright © The Author (2017).",Click here for full text options,auditory naming task [other term],,,

It is an approved adjunctive treatment in adults, but not in children, with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. We present the first pediatric application of RNS. Method(s): Eight pediatric patients (5M, 3F, ages 9-17 years) were deemed candidates for RNS implantation at a multidisciplinary epilepsy surgery case conference. Result(s):Indications included: 3 cases of bilateral focal epilepsy with bilateral MRI lesions, one previously treated with hemispherotomy; 3 non-lesional cases of failed focal resections/disconnections and/or VNS; and 2 cases of seizure foci in eloquent areas, one in a boy with Rasmussen's encephalitis who was not a candidate for hemispherotomy. In addition to 2 active cortical and/or depth electrodes at the putative seizure foci in all 8 cases, a decision was made to also implant one or two leads at suspected seizure foci in 2 of the 8 patients, and bilateral anterior thalamic depth electrodes in 2 more cases - based on evidence from deep brain stimulation trials. So far, 3 children have had the RNS parameters adjusted to a therapeutic level, with 50 to 90% seizure reduction after 5 to 12-months with no side effects. Conclusion(s): RNS may provide a palliative benefit in selected pediatric patients. Unlike in adults, where RNS can be applied based preference for non-resective treatment, desire to reduce medication dose, or for diagnostic purposes, the pediatric application of RNS should be limited to cases such as unresectable seizure foci, bilateral seizure onsets, or patients have exhausted approved medical and surgical options. The current RNS device can be connected to two active leads, but additional electrodes can be placed for possible future use. The device can also potentially be adapted for anterior thalamic stimulation.",Click here for full text options,conference abstract [other term],,,

vagus nerve stimulation","Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is defined as failure to respond to two different antidepressant treatments. Currently, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the gold standard in the treatment of TRD. ECT is a neurostimulatory option, in which seizures are elicited under anesthesia. However, despite its rapid acting and high efficacy, ECT is of ten used only as a treatment of last resort due to its stigma and the fair of cognitive side effects. Thus, new neurostimulatory options are approved or under clinical research to of fer patients with TRD alternative neurostimulatory treatment options. Non-invasive neurostimulatory options include repetitive transracial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST), while invasive options include vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The rTMS is approved for moderate depression or failure to respond to one antidepressant treatment. MST is a further development of rTMS using strong alternating magnetic stimulation to elicit seizures under anesthesia. A more focal seizure induction compared to ECT is used. Preliminary data demonstrated a similar response to ECT combined with a superior cognitive side effect prof ile. VNS has approval for long-term adjunctive treatment of chronic or recurrent depression. However, it is not an acute neurostimulatory option compared to ECT. Furthermore, DBS is the most invasive new neurostimulatory option for severe TRD under clinical research. Acute and long-term safety and efficacy data will be presented. Thus, the question is which patient responds to which neurostimulatory treatment option? That will be discussed in this educational symposium.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Chronic subthreshold cortical stimulation (SCSC) is a novel brain stimulation technique that lowers seizures probability and offers an alternative therapy (Lundstrom et al., 2016). Choosing appropriate stimulation parameters depends on estimating cortical excitability. Here, we summarize the results of patients treated with SCSC and describe several intrinsic excitability measures (IEMs) used to estimate cortical excitability during SCSC. Method(s): Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data from seven patients with DRE were analyzed respectively upon admission (EpiAdm) and after the initiation of cortical stimulation (EpiStim). Patients were implanted with subdural grid electrodes. Six 15-minute blocks of EEG data for each of 16 electrodes were reviewed per patient upon admission (EpiAdm) and during stimulation (EpiStim). Spikes were detected via a previously validated method for automated detection (Barkmeier et al., 2012). Slow oscillation phase and synchrony were measured for oscillations in the 0.5-2 Hz frequency band. The seizure onset zone (SOZ) was defined as the contacts involved at immediate seizure onset. Result(s): SCSC lowers seizure probability and focally decreases the rate of interictal spikes at the SOZ (Lundstrom et al., 2016). Average spike rate was decreased, spike phase in relation to underlying slow oscillations (0.5-2 Hz) was later, and a global synchrony measure was decreased for EpiStim compared to EpiAdm. These same measures show increased cortical excitability for contacts in the SOZ compared to the non-SOZ in the EpiAdm group. Used in conjunction, these IEMs predicted the SOZ for 8 of 14 contacts. CoNCLusions: SCSC offers a potential alternative treatment option for focal DRE. Interictal spike rate, spike phase in relation to slow oscillations, and synchrony are IEMs that potentially can be used to estimate cortical excitability. An efficient means for estimating seizure threshold would improve the efficacy of brain stimulation techniques such as SCSC.",Click here for full text options,,,,

This hypothesis, however, has been challenged by difficulties in eliciting ecological smiling in standard laboratory settings. Here we report of a case where these difficulties were overcome by combining electrical stimulation and intracranial electroencephalogram recording in a patient with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The stimulation of the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) elicited a smiling facial expression. The same leads exploring pACC showed an increase of gamma band activity (50-100 Hz) during the observation of video-clips depicting actors laughing, relative to video-clips depicting actors crying or producing a neutral expression. These findings indicate that both smile production and recognition are encoded in pACC and further support the role of this region in social cognition.Copyright © 2016 American Psychological Association.",Click here for full text options,*pregenual anterior cingulate cortex [other term],,,

weight gain","Epilepsy is a common yet heterogeneous disease. As a result, management often requires complex decision making. The ultimate goal of seizure management is for the patient to have no seizures and no considerable adverse effects from the treatment. Antiepileptic drugs are the mainstay of therapy, with more than 20 medications currently approved in the United States. Antiepileptic drug selection requires an understanding of the patient's epilepsy, along with consideration of comorbidities and potential for adverse events. After a patient has failed at least 2 appropriate antiepileptic drugs, they are determined to be medically refractory. At this time, additional therapy, including dietary, device, or surgical treatments, need to be considered, typically at a certified epilepsy center. All these treatments require consideration of the potential for seizure freedom, balanced against potential adverse effects, and can have a positive effect on seizure control and quality of life. This review article discussed the treatment options available for adults with epilepsy, including medical, surgical, dietary, and device therapies.Copyright © 2016 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research",Click here for full text options,"modified Atkins diet [other term]

Several of them are already available or in ongoing clinical trials. These new compounds should take advantage of new insights into the basic pathophysiology of epileptogenesis, drug metabolism and drug interactions. Many of them still need to be further evaluated mainly in real-world observational trials and registries. Among newer anticonvulsant drugs for partial-onset seizures (POSs), rufinamide, lacosamide, eslicarbazepine and perampanel are those new treatment options for which more substantial clinical evidence is currently available, both in adults and, to some extent, in children. Among the newest anticonvulsant drugs, brivaracetam, a high-affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A ligand, reported to be 10- to 30-fold more potent than levetiracetam, is highly effective in a broad range of experimental models of focal and generalized seizures. Unlike levetiracetam, brivaracetam does not inhibit high-voltage Ca2+ channels and AMPA receptors and appears to inhibit neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels playing a role as a partial antagonist. Brivaracetam has a linear pharmacokinetic profile, is extensively metabolized and is excreted by urine (only 8%-11% unchanged). It does not seem to influence the pharmacokinetics of other antiepileptic drugs. It was approved in the European Union in January 2016 and in the US in February 2016 as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of POS in patients older than 16 years of age. To date, its clinical efficacy as adjunctive antiepileptic treatment in adults with refractory POS at doses between 50 and 200 mg daily has been extensively assessed in two Phase IIb and four Phase III randomized controlled studies. Long-term extension studies show sustained efficacy of brivaracetam. Overall, the drug is generally well tolerated with only mild-to-moderate side effects. This is true also by intravenous route. Brivaracetam has not yet been evaluated as monotherapy or in comparison with other new anticonvulsant drugs.Copyright © 2017 Coppola et al.",Click here for full text options,,,,

white matter lesion","Background Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease who suffer from severe motor fluctuations. The most common surgery-related complications are temporary confusion, bleedings, infections, and seizures. Seizures have been described to occur mainly around the time of the implantation of electrodes and, at present, the best established risk factors for seizures in association with DBS surgery are bleedings. A postoperative status epilepticus as complication of DBS surgery has never been described before. Case Description We report on a patient with Parkinson's disease who developed focal seizures of the right hand and an increasing somnolence, which led to a comatose state 3 days after DBS surgery. Repeated electroencephalograms indicated a status epilepticus, which continued for 2 months until the patient regained consciousness. The patient's state improved slowly. Although basically a good effect of DBS on her parkinsonian symptoms was observed, severe neuropsychologic deficits persisted. Unfortunately, she died 8 months after surgery as a consequence of a fall with a complicated pelvic fracture. Conclusions This is a first report on a status epilepticus after DBS surgery, implicating that this complication has to be considered as differential diagnosis in somnolent patients after this operation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Single-pulse cortical direct electrical stimulation (DES) during intracerebral EEG monitoring allows the investigation of brain connectivity by eliciting cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). However, PP paradigm using intracerebral DES has rarely been reported and has never been previously compared with TMS. Objective(s): The work was intended (i) to verify that the well-established modulations of MEPs following PP TMS remain similar using DES in the motor cortex, and (ii) to evaluate if a similar pattern could be observed in distant cortico-cortical connections through modulations of CCEP. Method(s): Three patients undergoing intracerebral EEG monitoring with electrodes implanted in the central region were studied. Single-pulse DES (1-3 mA, 1 ms, 0.2 Hz) and PP DES using six interstimulus intervals (5, 15, 30, 50, 100, and 200 ms) in the motor cortex with concomitant recording of CCEPs and MEPs in contralateral muscles were performed. Finally, a navigated PP TMS session targeted the intracranial stimulation site to record TMS-induced MEPs in two patients. Result(s): MEP modulations elicited by PP intracerebral DES proved similar among the three patients and to those obtained by PP TMS. CCEP modulations elicited by PP intracerebral DES usually showed a pattern comparable to that of MEP, although a different pattern could be observed occasionally. Conclusion(s): PP intracerebral DES seems to involve excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms similar to PP TMS and allows the recording of intracortical inhibition and facilitation modulation on cortico-cortical connections.

The study compared both techniques in severe chronic DOC patients. Method(s): Sixteen DOC patients were allocated to two groups (A and B). A three week baseline either followed a frontal N-LT (0,1 mJ/mm2, 10 min per session), five times a week over four weeks (group A), or a F-SWT (0,1 mJ/mm2, 4000 stimuli per session) three times a week over four weeks (group B). The primary variable was the revised Coma Recovery Scale (r-CRS, 0-23), blindly assessed. Result(s): Both groups improved in the r-CRS over time, but revealed no differences between groups. One patient of group B had a focal seizure in the third therapy week. One patient with akinetic mutism improved most and three patients with global hypoxia did not improve at all. Conclusion(s): Both options might be an option to increase alertness and awareness of chronic DOC patients. An akinetic mutism seems to be a positive and severe cerebral hypoxia a negative predictor. Epileptic seizures are a potential unwanted side effect.

However, studies of patients with epileptic vertigo or dizziness with concurrent EEG monitoring are scarce. We performed the present study to investigate the incidence and localizing value of vertigo and dizziness in patients with epilepsy who had confirmation of EEG changes via video-EEG monitoring. Data of aura and clinical seizure episodes of 831 consecutive patients who underwent video-EEG monitoring were analyzed retrospectively. Out of 831 patients, 40 patients (4.8%) experienced vertigo or dizziness as aura (mean age, 32.8 +/- 11.8 years), all of whom had partial seizures. Eight had mesial temporal, 20 had lateral temporal, four had frontal, one had parietal, and seven had occipital lobe onset seizures. An intracranial EEG with cortical stimulation study was performed in seven patients, and the area of stimulation-induced vertigo or dizziness coincided with the ictal onset area in only one patient. Our study showed that vertigo or dizziness is a common aura in patients with epilepsy, and that the temporal lobe is the most frequent ictal onset area in these patients. However, it can be suggested that the symptomatogenic area in patients with epileptic vertigo and dizziness may not coincide with the ictal onset area.Copyright © 2016",Click here for full text options,"occipital lobe epilepsy / diagnosis [other term]

Therefore the individual patient's language distribution is investigated by intraoperative direct cortical stimulation (DCS) during awake surgery. Yet, not all patients qualify for awake surgery. Non-invasive language mapping by repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has frequently shown a high correlation in comparison with the results of DCS language mapping in terms of language-negative brain regions. The present study analyses the extent of resection (EOR) and functional outcome of patients who underwent left-sided perisylvian resection of brain lesions based purely on rTMS language mapping. Method(s): Four patients with left-sided perisylvian brain lesions (two gliomas WHO III, one glioblastoma, one cavernous angioma) underwent rTMS language mapping prior to surgery. Data from rTMS language mapping and rTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fibre tracking (DTI-FT) were transferred to the intraoperative neuronavigation system. Preoperatively, 5 days after surgery (POD5), and 3 months after surgery (POM3) clinical follow-up examinations were performed. Result(s): No patient suffered from a new surgery-related aphasia at POM3. Three patients underwent complete resection immediately, while one patient required a second rTMS-based resection some days later to achieve the final, complete resection. Conclusion(s): The present study shows for the first time the feasibility of successfully resecting language-eloquent brain lesions based purely on the results of negative language maps provided by rTMS language mapping and rTMS-based DTI-FT. In very select cases, this technique can provide a rescue strategy with an optimal functional outcome and EOR when awake surgery is not feasible.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Methods Results of electrical cortical stimulation were examined in epilepsy surgery candidates in whom invasive electrodes were implanted. The exact localization of subdural electrodes was defined by fusion of 3-dimensional reconstructed MRI and CT images in 13 patients and by analysis of plane skull X-rays and intraoperative visual localization of the electrodes in another 7 patients. Results Results of electrical stimulation of the cortex were evaluated in a total of 128 patients in whom invasive electrodes were implanted for planning resective epilepsy surgery. Twenty patients, in whom negative motor responses were obtained, were included in the study. Bilateral upper limb negative motor responses were more often elicited from stimulation of the mesial frontal cortex whereas stimulation of the lateral central cortex leads to contralateral upper limb negative motor responses (p < 0.0001). Bilateral negative motor responses were exclusively found in the superior frontal gyrus whereas contralateral negative motor responses localized predominantly in the anterior part of the precentral gyrus (p < 0.0001). Conclusions Exact localization using 3-D fusion methods revealed that negative motor areas are widely distributed throughout the precentral gyrus and the mesial fronto-central cortex showing functional differences with regard to unilateral and bilateral upper limb representation. Significance The lateral fronto-central negative motor area serves predominantly contralateral upper limb motor control whereas the mesial frontal negative motor area represents bilateral upper limb movement control.Copyright © 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology",Click here for full text options,*cortical negative motor area [other term],,,

Increasingly, neurostimulation provides an alternative treatment strategy for these patients. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is well established. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and cortical responsive stimulation (CRS) are newer neurostimulation therapies with recently published long-Term efficacy and safety data. In this literature review, we introduce these therapies to a non-specialist audience. Furthermore, we compare and contrast long-Term (5-year) outcomes of newer neurostimulation techniques with the more established VNS. A search to identify all studies reporting long-Term efficacy (>5a ..years) of VNS, CRS and DBS in patients with refractory focal/partial epilepsy was conducted using PubMed and Cochrane databases. The outcomes compared were responder rate, percentage seizure frequency reduction, seizure freedom, adverse events, neuropsychological outcome and quality of life. We identified 1 study for DBS, 1 study for CRS and 4 studies for VNS. All neurostimulation technologies showed long-Term efficacy, with progressively better seizure control over time. Sustained improvement in quality of life measures was demonstrated in all modalities. Intracranial neurostimulation had a greater side effect profile compared with extracranial stimulation, though all forms of stimulation are safe. Methodological differences between the studies mean that direct comparisons are not straightforward. We have synthesised the findings of this review into a pragmatic decision tree, to guide the further management of the individual patient with pharmacoresistant focal-onset epilepsy.Copyright © 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",Click here for full text options,"*cortical responsive stimulation [other term]

We report on the postmarketing clinical efficacy, adverse events, and retention rates of RTG in adult patients with refractory focal epilepsy. Method(s): Clinical features before and during RTG treatment were retrospectively collected from patients treated at four German epilepsy centers in 2011 and 2012. Result(s): A total of 195 patients were included. Daily RTG doses ranged from 100 to 1500 mg. Retigabine reduced seizure frequency or severity for 24.6% and led to seizure-freedom in 2.1% of the patients but had no apparent effect in 43.1% of the patients. Seizure aggravation occurred in 14.9%. The one-, two-, and three-year retention rates amounted to 32.6%, 7.2%, and 5.7%, respectively. Adverse events were reported by 76% of the patients and were mostly CNS-related. Blue discolorations were noted in three long-term responders. Three possible SUDEP cases occurred during the observation period, equalling an incidence rate of about 20 per 1000. patient years. Conclusion(s): Our results are similar to other pivotal trials with respect to the long-term, open-label extensions and recent postmarketing studies. Despite the limitations of the retrospective design, our observational study suggests that RTG leads to good seizure control in a small number of patients with treatment-refractory seizures. However, because of the rather high percentage of patients who experienced significant adverse events, we consider RTG as a drug of reserve.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The significance of motor cortex stimulation (MCS) in chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) syndromes remains unclear. Different techniques are performed worldwide in regard to operative procedure, stimulation parameters, test trials, and implanted materials. OBJECTIVE(S): To present the clinical experiences of a single center with MCS, surgical approach, complications, and follow-up as a prospective, noncontrolled clinical trial. METHOD(S): The implantation of epidural leads over the motor cortex was performed via a burr hole technique with neuronavigation and intraoperative neurostimulation. Special focus was placed on a standardized test trial with an external stimulation device and the implementation of a double-blinded or placebo test phase to identify false-positive responders. RESULT(S): A total of 36 patients with TNP were operated on, and MCS was performed. In 26 of the 36 patients (72%), a significant pain reduction from a mean of 8.11 to 4.58 (on the visual analog scale) during the test trial was achieved (P <.05). Six patients were identified as false-positive responders (17%). At the last available follow-up of 26 patients (mean, 5.6 years), active MCS led to a significant pain reduction compared with the preoperative pain ratings (mean visual analog scale score, 5.01; P <.05). CONCLUSION(S): MCS is an additional therapeutic option for patients with refractory chronic TNP, and significant long-term pain suppression can be achieved. Placebo or double-blinded testing is mandatory.

The main advantage is the possibility to study the epileptogenic neuronal network in its dynamic and 3-dimensional aspect, with optimal time and space correlation, with the clinical semiology of the patient's seizures. The main clinical challenge for the near future remains in the further refinement of specific selection criteria for the different methods of invasive monitoring, with the ultimate goal of comparing and validating the results (long-term seizure-free outcome) obtained from different methods of invasive monitoring.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc..",Click here for full text options,,electrode / adverse device effect,,

With increased understanding of brain function and development of electroencephalographic methods, nonlesional epilepsy began to be treated with resection in the 1950s. Methodological improvements and increased understanding of pathophysiology followed, and the advent of stereotaxy and ablative technology in the 1960s and 1970s heralded a new era of minimally invasive, targeted procedures for lesional and nonlesional epilepsy. Current techniques combine stereotactic methods, improved ablative technologies, and electroencephalographic methods for a multidisciplinary approach to the neurosurgical treatment of epilepsy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc..",Click here for full text options,corpus callosotomy [other term],,,

Moreover, surgical approaches in this region are challenging. In this paper the authors report on a patient presenting with SII epilepsy with a tumor in the left deep parietal operculum. The patient was a 24-year-old man who suffered daily partial seizures with extremely uncomfortable dysesthesia and/or occasional pain on his right side. MRI revealed a tumor in the medial aspect of the anterior transverse parietal gyrus, surrounding the posterior insular point. Long-term video electroencephalography monitoring with scalp electrodes failed to show relevant changes to seizures. Resection with cortical and subcortical mapping under awake conditions was performed. A negative response to stimulation was observed at the subcentral gyrus during language and somatosensory tasks; thus, the transcortical approach (specifically, a transsubcentral gyral approach) was used through this region. Subcortical stimulation at the medial aspect of the anterior parietal gyrus and the posterior insula around the posterior insular point elicited strong dysesthesia and pain in his right side, similar to manifestation of his seizure. The tumor was completely removed and pathologically diagnosed as pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. His epilepsy disappeared without neurological deterioration postoperatively. In this case study, 3 points are clinically significant. First, the clinical manifestation of this case was quite rare, although still representative of SII epilepsy. Second, the location of the lesion made surgical removal challenging, and the transsubcentral gyral approach was useful when intraoperative mapping was performed during awake surgery. Third, intraoperative mapping demonstrated that the patient experienced pain with electrical stimulation around the posterior insular point. Thus, this report demonstrated the safe and effective use of the transsubcentral gyral approach during awake surgery to resect deep parietal opercular lesions, clarified electrophysiological characteristics in the SII area, and achieved successful tumor resection with good control of epilepsy.Copyright © AANS, 2016.",Click here for full text options,"*left deep parietal operculum tumor / *surgery [other term]

Method(s):We describe results of extraoperative electrical stimulation of stereotactic electrodes in 3 patients with epilepsy who underwent presurgical evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Contacts of these electrodes sampled, among other structures, the suprainsular white matter of the left hemisphere. Result(s):Aside from speech disturbance and speech arrest, subcortical electrical stimulation of white matter tracts directly superior to the insula representing the anterior part of the arcuate fascicle, reproducibly induced complex verbal auditory phenomena including (1) hearing one's own voice in the absence of overt speech, and (2) lack of perception of arrest or alteration in ongoing repetition of words. Conclusion(s):These results represent direct evidence that the anterior part of the arcuate fascicle is part of a network that is important in the mediation of speech planning and awareness likely by linking the language areas of the inferior parietal and posterior inferior frontal cortices. More specifically, our observations suggest that this structure may be relevant to the pathophysiology of thought disorders and auditory verbal hallucinations.Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.",Click here for full text options,*auditory verbal hallucination [other term],,,

However, the exact mechanisms by which electrical stimulation disturbs behavior remain largely unknown. In this case report, we describe a new method to explore the propagation toward cortical sites of a brief pulse applied to an eloquent white matter pathway. We present a patient, operated on in awake condition for removal of a cavernoma of the left ventral premotor cortex. At the end of the resection, the application of 60 Hz stimulation in the white matter of the operculum induced anomia. Stimulating the same site at a frequency of 1 Hz during 70 seconds allowed to record responses on electrodes put over Broca's area and around the inferior part of central sulcus. Axono-cortical evoked potentials were then obtained by averaging unitary responses, time-locked to the stimulus. We then discuss the origin of these evoked axono-cortical potentials and the likely pathway connecting the stimulation site to the recorded cortical sites.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Click here for full text options,"*axono cortical evoked potential [other term]

OBJECTIVE(S): To report our clinical experience with robotic SEEG implantation and to define its utility in the management of patients with medically refractory epilepsy. METHOD(S): The prospective observational analyses included all patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy who underwent robot-assisted stereotactic placement of depth electrodes for extraoperative brain monitoring between November 2009 and May 2013. Technical nuances of the robotic implantation technique are presented, as well as an analysis of demographics, time of planning and procedure, seizure outcome, in vivo accuracy, and procedure-related complications. RESULT(S): One hundred patients underwent 101 robot-assisted SEEG procedures. Their mean age was 33.2 years. In total, 1245 depth electrodes were implanted. On average, 12.5 electrodes were implanted per patient. The time of implantation planning was 30 minutes on average (range, 15-60 minutes). The average operative time was 130 minutes (range, 45-160 minutes). In vivo accuracy (calculated in 500 trajectories) demonstrated a median entry point error of 1.2 mm (interquartile range, 0.78-1.83 mm) and a median target point error of 1.7 mm (interquartile range, 1.20-2.30 mm). Of the group of patients who underwent resective surgery (68 patients), 45 (66.2%) gained seizure freedom status. Mean follow-up was 18 months. The total complication rate was 4%. CONCLUSION(S): The robotic SEEG technique and method were demonstrated to be safe, accurate, and efficient in anatomically defining the epileptogenic zone and subsequently promoting sustained seizure freedom status in patients with difficult-tolocalize seizures.Copyright © 2015 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Click here for full text options,"intraparenchymal hematoma / complication [other term]

Background(s): DBS is effective for some neurological and psychiatric conditions. IDE has been anectodally reported. The etiology, predisposing factors and prognosis of this complication are unknown. Method(s): IDE was defined as edema along the DBS lead, Occurring >=72 hours postoperatively, in absence of trauma, vascular events or infection. Information on patients with IDE was collected in a standardized way. A systematic search was performed in Pubmed. Result(s): Twelve new patients presenting with 14 episodes of IDE are described. From the literature, 38 patients were identified. No common surgical aspects or patient-related factors were identified as risk predictors for the onset of IDE. Symptoms included deterioration of the stimulation effect, seizures and focal neurological signs. Although the condition is self-limiting, with symptoms resolution in 28.5 days on average, three patients underwent surgical revision and seven received antibiotics. Conclusion(s): IDE is a rare complication of DBS procedures, presenting from a few days to months after surgery. Symptoms can be mild and not-specific. The diagnosis of IDE is made after exclusion of vascular events or infections. The pathophysiology is still unexplained. IDE is self-limiting; steroidal treatment might shorten recovery time. It may be safer to switch off stimulation or apply constant-current stimulation. The recognition of this complication can help avoiding unnecessary surgical procedures (system explantation) and antibiotic treatment. (Figure Presented).",Click here for full text options,,,,

diseases","Backround and purpose: Neurostimulation is an emerging treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. Excitabilityreducing neurostimulation is pursued as an alternative therapeutic strategy for refractory epilepsy when drugs and surgery fail or are not indicated. For intracranial neurostimulation, stimulation electrodes are inserted into intracerebral targets in 'deep brain stimulation' (DBS) or placed over the cortical convexity for 'cortical stimulation' (CS) to administer electrical pulses to central nervous system structures. These modalities of neurostimulation are not entirely new for neurological indications. Some have been extensively applied in movement disorders and pain. Several new indications such as obsessive compulsive behaviour and cluster headache are being investigated with promising results. In the past DBS and CS of different brain structures such as the cerebellum, the locus coeruleus and the thalamus were performed mainly in patients with spasticity or psychiatric disorders who had epilepsy as a comorbidity. The vast progress in biotechnology along with the experience in other neurological diseases in the past ten years has led to a renewed interest in intracerebral stimulation for epilepsy. Several epilepsy centers around the world have recently conducted trials with DBS in different intracerebral structures such as the thalamus, the subthalamic nucleus, the caudate nucleus and medial temporal lobe structures. Also CS has been investigated in a multicenter trial in a socalled closed-loop system. Especially CS of eloquent cortex may be developed into a valuable alternative for resective surgery to treat refractory partial focal seizures arising from eloquent cortex.",Click here for full text options,,,,

We collected recordings from 16 different cortical areas and analyzed the perturbation effects in a 200ms time range after the stimulus using both cross-Coherence and Granger causality and comparing the two procedures. Results show that the overall interaction intensity involves a wider frequency range during wakefulness than during NREM sleep. Moreover, comparing similar Coherence intensity thresholds, the number of interacting areas is sharply higher during wakefulness. However, during the NREM phase, interactions show a highly directional behavior that is not present during wakefulness. The study displays which areas are mainly involved in reciprocal G-causal interactions, paving the way to a following research on their functional meaning.",Click here for full text options,*Granger causality [other term],,,

*thalamus dorsomedial nucleus","The relationships between interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the anterior (ANT) and dorsomedial nuclei (DMNT) of the thalamus and electro-clinical parameters in pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy patients receiving intrathalamic electrodes for deep brain stimulation (DBS) were investigated. Thalamus-localized IEDs (LIEDs) and surface EEG (sEEG)-IEDs were evaluated in eight patients who underwent ANT-DBS. Occurrence and frequency of ANT- and DMNT-LIEDs and pre-operative sEEG-IEDs were examined with respect to seizure onset location and seizure outcome following ANT-DBS. LIEDs were identified in all eight patients, in the ANT, DMNT, or both. ANT-LIEDs were observed in all patients with an unequivocal temporal seizure onset zone. The ANT-LIED frequency correlated with pre-surgical sEEG-IED frequency (rho = 0.76, p = 0.033) and predicted ANT-DBS responsiveness (T = -2.6; p = 0.0428). Of the five patients with bilateral sEEG-IEDs, all had ANT-LIEDs, but only one patient had DMNT-LIEDs. All patients with no or unilateral sEEG-IEDs had DMNT-LIEDs. Observation of LIEDS in the ANT and DMNT supports the hypothesis that these nuclei are involved in propagation of focal epileptic activity. Their correspondence with differing electro-clinical features suggests that these nuclei are functionally distinguishable nodes within the epileptic networks of individual patients.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Click here for full text options,*thalamic interictal epileptiform discharge / *surgery / *therapy [other term],,,

tonic clonic seizure","Introduction: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently considered a promising neuromodulation therapy for refractory epilepsy not suitable for resective surgery. several anatomical targets and different stimulation approaches have been proposed in order to obtain satisfactory seizures reduction. As expected, according with different patterns of neural pathways involvement, the eficacy of each anatomical target stimulation in reducing seizure frequency varies among the different epileptic syndromes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We reviewed the current literature on this topic to provide an overview of the clinical eficacy of the main stimulation targets (anterior nucleus of the thalamus [aNT], hippocampus formation [Hf] and centromedian nucleus of the thalamus [CMT]) related to the different epileptic syndromes. We also summarized the available data concerning side effects, neuropsychological outcome, quality of life and future perspective of DBs in intractable epilepsy. eViDeNce sYNTHesis: Encouraging results were reported for each target stimulation. However, only in aNT and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) the eficacy and safety were tested on large series of patients and achieving class I evidence level. Conslusions: We concluded that responsive stimulation could be more appropriate in focal epilepsy, while aNT stimulation could be properly performed also in multifocal seizures with predominant limbic involvement. Despite the small samples size, Hf stimulation reduces seizure frequency in (bi) temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as cMT stimulation is able to reduce, seizure frequency, in generalized epilepsy.Copyright © 2016 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.",Click here for full text options,,,,

*stereoelectroencephalography","Intracranial EEG has been in use for more than 50 years in the presurgical evaluation of patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy. The stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) method has expanded very significantly over the last 5 years, in parallel with the increase in the number of complex cases (i.e., MRI-negative) being referred with medically intractable focal epilepsy to major epilepsy surgery centers. Some centers with extensive experience in subdural electrodes are indeed changing or have changed to SEEG as the principal exploration technique, which suggests that SEEG might offer specific benefits through its approach to accurately localizing the epileptogenic zone. However, interpretation of SEEG, which is a key step to its usefulness, may vary from one center to another. This may be due to different conceptual bases and the available expertise in each center. This heterogeneity in use of SEEG should be taken into account as it could contribute to erroneous conclusions and thus unfavorable outcome of epilepsy surgery. At present, there is a lack of guidelines for optimal SEEG use, although development of these is in progress. It remains challenging to translate SEEG interpretation into a practical approach to delineating surgical strategy. Identification of clear biomarkers will help in the definition of the epileptogenic zone and subsequent cortical resection. In addition, SEEG seems to be a unique tool for the in vivo investigation of human cerebral networks distributed over several lobes or sublobar structures, allowing a better understanding of their functioning.© Copyright 2016 by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society.",Click here for full text options,,,,

weight reduction","Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder in adults and requires treatment with antiepileptic medication. While the majority of patients with epilepsy can be treated with medication, about one third will fail on medical treatment. Therefore, other treatment options such as surgery, devices, and the ketogenic diet are other options to consider, in addition to medical treatment. The treatment of epilepsy requires many other factors to be taken into consideration, and these include, but are not limited to, age, gender, coexistent medical conditions, and the use of concomitant medications. The goal of treatment is to provide optimal seizure control while using the least possible number of medications, particularly for young females at reproductive age or the elderly who may suffer from other medical diseases and receive other concomitant medications. Certain conditions may co-exist with epilepsy, such as migraine,mooddisorder, and memory disturbances, therefore the decision to choose the most appropriate medication for epilepsy patients should also involve treatment of these conditions. Here, we review current clinical practice in epilepsy and focus on the most common problems and conditions that clinicians face on a daily basis to treat adult patients with epilepsy. Side effect profiles, spectrum of efficacy and optimal choices per predominant type of seizures are summarized and can be used for educational purposes.",Click here for full text options,"idiopathic generalized epilepsy / drug therapy [other term]

Casusitic reports were positive regarding the non-invasive brain stimulation with either frontal near infrared laser stimulation (N-LLT) or focused shock wave therapy of the cranium (F-SWT). The study intended to compare both techniques in chronic DOC patients, either classified as patients in the syndrome of unresponsive wakelfulness (UWS) or minimal conscious state (MCS). Method(s): The randomised baseline-treatment study included 16 DOC patients, allocated to two groups (A and B). Following a three week baseline, either a frontal N-LLT (10 mW/cm2, 10 min per session), five times a week over four weeks (group A), or a F-SW (10 mW/cm2, 4000 stimuli per session) three times a week over four weeks (group B) were applied. The primary variable was the revised Coma Recovery Scale (r-CRS, 0-23), blindly assessed. Result(s): The clinical data of both groups were comparable at study onset. Over the period of the interventions, the r-CRS of both groups improved over time. Between group differences did not occur at any of the measurement points. One patient of group B had a focal seizure in the third therapy week. Merely one patient with an akinetic mutism improved her competence in the activities of daily living. Three UWS-patients, who had suffered from global cerebral damage due to hypoxia, did not improve their r-CRS scores at all. Care-takers of 11 patients rated the interventions positively as the interactions had improved. Conclusion(s): Both options are an interesting and equipotent tool to increase the alertness and awareness of chronic DOC patients. An akinetic mutism seems to be a positive and a global brain damage due to hypoxia a negative predictor. Epileptic seizures are a potential unwanted side effect. More clinical studies are warranted.Copyright © Hippocampus Verlag 2016.",Click here for full text options,"*transcranial near infrared laser therapy [other term]

preoperative evaluation","We report the case of a 14-year-old male with a history of focal seizures since the age of six due to a focal cortical dysplasia located within the left frontal lobe. The patient's seizures proved to be refractory to treatments with Oxcarbazepine, Lamotrigine, Valproate, and Clobazame. Because fMRI for language mapping suggested a close spatial relationship of the lesion and Broca's area, invasive language mapping was performed using a subdural grid for direct cortical stimulation. This suggested a clear topographic distinction between the lesion and Broca's area, finally enabling language retaining lesionectomy. This case illustrates some pitfalls of fMRI language mapping in preoperative workup for epilepsy surgery.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Click here for full text options,,,"Spracherhaltende Resektion einer fokalen kortikalen Dys-plasie neben dem Broca-Areal: Invasive Sprachkartierung ermoglicht epilepsiechirurgischen Eingriff in einem, zunachst als inoperabel eingeschatzten Fall.",

This study aimed to address the spatial profile of cortical excitability changes in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) by using TMS and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Method(s): Eighteen patients with TLE and 18 healthy control subjects were recruited. Resting motor threshold (RMT) and intracortical inhibition (ICI) were measured to reflect motor cortical excitability by using TMS. A whole-head MEG was applied to record auditory and somatosensory evoked responses to paired-pulse stimuli. A paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) ratio, defined as the amplitude ratio between responses to the second and the first stimuli, was used to assess the auditory and somatosensory cortical excitability. A high PPI ratio suggests an increase in cortical excitability, while a low ratio indicates a decrease in excitability. Result(s): Compared to control subjects, TLE patients exhibited increased RMT in motor cortex and higher PPI ratios for auditory P50m and somatosensory P35m responses. Notably, patients with a lower seizure frequency tended to exhibit a higher RMT or a lower P35m PPI ratio. Conclusion(s): Present data suggest that the cortical excitability alteration in focal epilepsy is widely distributed beyond the epileptic focus and the profiles of excitability change correlate with clinical severity in terms of seizure frequency. Combined MEG and TMS studies provide new insight into the inter-ictal cortical excitability profiles in patients with epilepsy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Click here for full text options,"paired pulse inhibition [other term]

In this report, the findings from the same study are presented for quality of life, which was a supportive analysis, and for mood, which was assessed as a secondary safety endpoint. Method(s): The study was a multicenter randomized controlled double-blinded trial of responsive neurostimulation in 191 patients with medically resistant focal epilepsy. During a 4-month postimplant blinded period, patients were randomized to receive responsive stimulation or sham stimulation, after which all patients received responsive neurostimulation in open label to complete 2. years. Quality of life (QOL) and mood surveys were administered during the baseline period, at the end of the blinded period, and at year 1 and year 2 of the open label period. Result(s): The treatment and sham groups did not differ at baseline. Compared with baseline, QOL improved in both groups at the end of the blinded period and also at 1. year and 2. years, when all patients were treated. At 2. years, 44% of patients reported meaningful improvements in QOL, and 16% reported declines. There were no overall adverse changes in mood or in suicidality across the study. Findings were not related to changes in seizures and antiepileptic drugs, and patients with mesial temporal seizure onsets and those with neocortical seizure onsets both experienced improvements in QOL. Conclusion(s): Treatment with targeted responsive neurostimulation does not adversely affect QOL or mood and may be associated with improvements in QOL in patients, including those with seizures of either mesial temporal origin or neocortical origin.Copyright © 2015.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Seizure outcome of resective surgery for focal seizures associated with focal lesions is satisfactory. Particularly for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, surgical treatment should be considered from the earlier stage of the disease. Meanwhile, surgical outcome in nonlesional extratemporal lobe epilepsy is still to be improved using various approaches. Disconnective surgeries reduce surgical complications of extensive resections while achieving equivalent or better seizure outcomes. Multiple subpial transection is still being modified expecting a better outcome by transection to the vertical cortices along the sulci- and multi-directional transection from a single entry point. Hippocampal transection is expected to preserve memory function while interrupting the abnormal epileptic synchronization. Proper selection or combination of subdural and depth electrodes and a wide-band analysis of electroencephalography may improve the accurate localization of epileptogenic region. Patients for whom curative resective surgery is not indicated because of generalized or bilateral multiple nature of their epilepsies, neuromodulation therapies are options of treatment which palliate their seizures.Copyright © 2015 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.

We investigated sleep-induced connectivity and excitability changes in 11 patients who underwent chronic implantation of subdural electrodes for epilepsy surgery. Single-pulse electrical stimuli were directly injected to a part of the cortices, and cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) and CCEP-related high-gamma activities (HGA: 100-200 Hz) were recorded from adjacent and remote cortices as proxies of effective connectivity and induced neuronal activity, respectively. HGA power during the initial CCEP component (N1) correlated with the N1 size itself across all states investigated. The degree of cortical connectivity and excitability changed during sleep depending on sleep stage, approximately showing dichotomy of awake vs. non-rapid eye movement (REM) [NREM] sleep. On the other hand, REM sleep partly had properties of both awake and NREM sleep, placing itself in the intermediate state between them. Compared with the awake state, single-pulse stimulation especially during NREM sleep induced increased connectivity (N1 size) and neuronal excitability (HGA increase at N1), which was immediately followed by intense inhibition (HGA decrease). The HGA decrease was temporally followed by the N2 peak (the second CCEP component), and then by HGA re-increase during sleep across all lobes. This HGA rebound or re-increase of neuronal synchrony was largest in the frontal lobe compared with the other lobes. These properties of sleep-induced changes of the cortex may be related to unconsciousness during sleep and frequent nocturnal seizures in frontal lobe epilepsy.Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Click here for full text options,corticocortical evoked potential [other term],,,

Method(s): This long-term follow-up is a continuation of a previously reported trial of 5-vs 0-V ANT stimulation. Long-term follow-up began 13 months after device implantation with stimulation parameters adjusted at the investigators' discretion. Seizure frequency was determined using daily seizure diaries. Result(s): The median percent seizure reduction from baseline at 1 year was 41%, and 69% at 5 years. The responder rate (>=50% reduction in seizure frequency) at 1 year was 43%, and 68% at 5 years. In the 5 years of follow-up, 16% of subjects were seizure-free for at least 6 months. There were no reported unanticipated adverse device effects or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages. The Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale and 31-item Quality of Life in Epilepsy measure showed statistically significant improvement over baseline by 1 year and at 5 years (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Long-term follow-up of ANT deep brain stimulation showed sustained efficacy and safety in a treatment-resistant population. Classification of evidence: This long-term follow-up provides Class IV evidence that for patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy, anterior thalamic stimulation is associated with a 69% reduction in seizure frequency and a 34% serious device-related adverse event rate at 5 years.Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): All participants were treated with a cranially implanted responsive neurostimulator that delivers stimulation to 1 or 2 seizure foci via chronically implanted electrodes when specific electrocorticographic patterns are detected (RNS System). Participants had completed a 2-year primarily open-label safety study (n 65) or a 2-year randomized blinded controlled safety and efficacy study (n 191); 230 participants transitioned into an ongoing 7-year study to assess safety and efficacy. Result(s): The average participant was 34 (+/-11.4) years old with epilepsy for 19.6 (+/-11.4) years. The median preimplant frequency of disabling partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures was 10.2 seizures a month. The median percent seizure reduction in the randomized blinded controlled trial was 44% at 1 year and 53% at 2 years (p < 0.0001, generalized estimating equation) and ranged from 48% to 66% over postimplant years 3 through 6 in the long-term study. Improvements in quality of life were maintained (p < 0.05). The most common serious device-related adverse events over the mean 5.4 years of follow-up were implant site infection (9.0%) involving soft tissue and neurostimulator explantation (4.7%). Conclusion(s): The RNS System is the first direct brain responsive neurostimulator. Acute and sustained efficacy and safety were demonstrated in adults with medically refractory partial onset seizures arising from 1 or 2 foci over a mean follow-up of 5.4 years. This experience supports the RNS System as a treatment option for refractory partial seizures. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that for adults with medically refractory partial onset seizures, responsive direct cortical stimulation reduces seizures and improves quality of life over a mean follow-up of 5.4 years.Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.",Click here for full text options,,implantable neurostimulator / adverse device effect,,

In a primate model of focal motor seizures induced by intracortical injection of penicillin, we recently showed that seizures propagated from the motor cortex towards the basal ganglia. Objective(s): Using the same animal model here, we hypothesized that disruption of subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity by chronic high frequency stimulation (HFS) could modify pathological excessive cortical synchronisation occurring during focal motor seizures, and therefore could reduce seizure activity. Method(s): Two monkeys were chronically implanted with one electrode positioned into the STN. In each experiment, seizures were induced during 6 hours by injecting penicillin into the motor cortex. During stimulation sessions, HFS-STN was applied at the beginning of penicillin injection. Result(s): Our results indicate that HFS-STN improved focal motor seizures by delaying the occurrence of the first seizure, by decreasing the number of seizures by 47% and therefore the total time spent seizing by 53% compared to control. These results argue for a therapeutic use of HFS-STN in motor seizures because they were obtained in a very severe primate model of motor status similar to that seen in human. Furthermore, HFS-STN was much more efficient than direct cortical HFS of the epileptic focus, which we already tested in the same primate model. Conclusion(s): The present study suggests that HFS-STN could be used as an experimental therapy when other therapeutic strategies are not possible or have failed in humans suffering from motor epilepsy but the present study still warrants controlled studies in humans.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A rat model of electrically induced self-sustained focal-onset epilepsy was employed. METHOD(S): A 16-contact depth-recording microelectrode was implanted bilaterally in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of Fischer 344 rats. The right microelectrode array included an integrated microcatheter for drug delivery at the distal tip. Bihemispheric spontaneous self-sustained limbic status epilepticus (SSLSE) was induced in freely moving rats using a 90-minute stimulation paradigm delivered to the right medial perforant white matter pathway. Immediately following SSLSE induction, closed-loop right PP stimulation therapy concurrent with on-demand nanoboluses of the AED [14C]-carisbamate (n = 4), or on-demand [14C]-carisbamate alone (n = 4), was introduced for a mean of 10 hours. In addition, 2 reference groups received either closed-loop stimulation therapy alone (n = 4) or stimulation therapy with saline vehicle only (n = 4). All animals were sacrificed after completing the specified therapy regimen. In situ [14C]-autoradiography was used to determine AED distribution. RESULT(S): Closed-loop direct stimulation therapy delivered unilaterally in the right PP aborted ictal runs detected in either ipsi-or contralateral hippocampi. Freely moving rats receiving closed-loop direct stimulation therapy with on demand intracerebral carisbamate delivery experienced a significant reduction in seizure frequency (p < 0.001) and minimized seizure frequency variability during the final 50% of the therapy/recording session compared with closed-loop stimulation therapy alone. CONCLUSION(S): Unilateral closed-loop direct stimulation therapy delivered to afferent hippocampal white matter pathways concurrent with on-demand ipsilateral intracerebral delivery of nano-bolused carisbamate can rapidly decrease the frequency of electrographic seizures in an active bihemispheric epileptic network. Additionally, direct pulsatile delivery of carisbamate can stabilize seizure frequency variability compared with direct stimulation therapy alone.Copyright © AANS, 2015.",Click here for full text options,"*closed loop direct neurostimulation therapy [other term]

thalamocortical tract

tonic clonic seizure","Generalized epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures caused by oscillatory neuronal firing throughout thalamocortical networks. Current therapeutic approaches often intervene at the level of the thalamus or cerebral cortex to ameliorate seizures. We review here the therapeutic potential of cerebellar stimulation. The cerebellum forms a prominent ascending input to the thalamus and, whereas stimulation of the foliated cerebellar cortex exerts inconsistent results, stimulation of the centrally located cerebellar nuclei (CN) reliably stops generalized seizures in experimental models. Stimulation of this area indicates that the period of stimulation with respect to the phase of the oscillations in thalamocortical networks can optimize its effect, opening up the possibility of developing on-demand deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatments.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Here, we evoked reproducible mental imagery of a postural illusion by intrasurgical electrostimulation of the central cortex. Case Report: A 24-year-old patient experienced seizures involving vivid mental imagery of biomechanically impossible movements of the upper limb. A right precentral low-grade glioma was diagnosed. Awake surgery with intraoperative electrostimulation sensorimotor mapping was performed. Remarkably, the same mental representations of biomechanically impossible movements of the left upper limb were repeatedly elicited during stimulation of the central cortex. These eloquent areas were preserved, even though the precentral part of the knob of the hand was removed. After a transient monoplegia, the patient recovered and resumed a normal life which included playing the guitar. Conclusion(s): These mental experiences of a postural illusion generated by intraoperative stimulation could be related to neuroplasticity mechanisms induced by the slow growth of low-grade glioma within the knob of the hand. Such a functional reorganization may explain why this area was removed without permanent deficits. This perception of biomechanically impossible movements during surgery might be due to a transient disruption by stimulating the frontoparietal network involved in the coding of the body image.Copyright © 2015 S.

We previously developed a rodent model of temporal lobe seizures that recapitulates the human electroencephalography (EEG) signature of ictal and postictal neocortical slow waves associated with behavioral impairments in level of consciousness. The mechanism of slow-wave production in epilepsy may involve suppression of the subcortical arousal systems including the brainstem and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. We hypothesized that intralaminar thalamic stimulation may lead to electrophysiologic and functional rescue from postictal slow waves and behavioral arrest. Methods We electrically stimulated the central lateral thalamic nucleus (a member of the intralaminar nuclei) under anesthesia and after electrically induced hippocampal seizures in anesthetized and in awake-behaving animal model preparations. Results We demonstrated a proof-of-principle restoration of electrophysiologic and behavioral measures of consciousness by stimulating the intralaminar thalamic nuclei after seizures. We measured decreased cortical slow waves and increased desynchronization and multiunit activity in the cortex with thalamic stimulation following seizures. Functionally, thalamic stimulation produced resumption of exploratory behaviors in the postictal state. Significance Targeting of nodes in the neural circuitry of consciousness has important medical implications. Impaired consciousness with epilepsy has dangerous consequences including decreased school/work performance, social stigmatization, and impaired airway protection. These data suggest a novel therapeutic approach for restoring consciousness after seizures. If paired with responsive neurostimulation, this may allow rapid implementation to improve level of consciousness in patients with epilepsy.Copyright © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2014 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Introduction: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) has been recently compared to a possible ""second therapeutic honeymoon"" for Parkinson's disease, as it might prevent the development of severe motor complications and lessen the social adjustment associated to disease progression. This study aims to evaluate whether an early surgical treatment could result in better long-term outcomes, comparing the follow-up evolution of 203 parkinsonian patients, treated at different stages of the disease course. Method(s): The retrospective allocation to Early- or Late-Stimulated groups was performed in accordance to disease severity at the time of surgery and motor fluctuations duration. Then, the two groups clinical outcomes were compared after more than 8 years of follow-up by means of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, reporting the overall disability experienced by patients during the entire observational period. Result(s): Subjects receiving an earlier STN-DBS showed a sustained improvement in the activities of daily living and motor complications, never reaching the severe levels of disability reported by Late-Stimulated patients at the time of surgical selection. After >=8 years of follow-up the Early-Stimulated group still reported a 28.7% lower impairment in activities of daily living and 43.8% lower duration of waking day spent in OFF compared to their pre-surgical basal scores. Conclusion(s): Although the limitation of a retrospective study design should be considered in the interpretation of data, our findings suggest that an earlier STN-DBS treatment might result in a more precocious stabilization of motor complications, with beneficial effects on the patient's social and professional life autonomy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Click here for full text options,*subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation [other term],,,

Wistar rat","Alterations in the connectivity patterns of the fMRI-based resting-state networks (RSNs) have been reported in several types of epilepsies. Evidence pointed out these alterations might be associated with the genesis and propagation of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). IEDs also evoke blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses, which have been used to delineate irritative zones during preoperative work-up. Therefore, one may expect a relationship between the topology of the IED-evoked BOLD response network and the altered spatial patterns of the RSNs. In this study, we used EEG recordings and fMRI data obtained simultaneously from a chronic model of focal epilepsy in Wistar rats to verify our hypothesis. We found that IED-evoked BOLD response networks comprise both cortical and subcortical structures with a rat-dependent topology. In all rats, IEDs evoke both activation and deactivation types of BOLD responses. Using a Granger causality method, we found that in many cases areas with BOLD deactivation have directed influences on areas with activation (p<0.05). We were able to predict topological properties (i.e., focal/diffused, unilateral/bilateral) of the IED-evoked BOLD response network by performing hierarchical clustering analysis on major spatial features of the RSNs. All these results suggest that IEDs and disruptions in the RSNs found previously in humans may be different manifestations of the same transient events, probably reflecting altered consciousness. In our opinion, the shutdown of specific nodes of the default mode network may cause uncontrollable excitability in other functionally connected brain areas. We conclude that IED-evoked BOLD responses (i.e., activation and deactivation) and alterations of RSNs are intrinsically related, and speculate that an understanding of their interplay is necessary to discriminate focal epileptogenesis and network propagation phenomena across different brain modules via hubbased connectivity.

We investigated the connectivity of the human limbic system using corticocortical evoked potential (CCEP). This retrospective analysis included 28 patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy who underwent stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and CCEP. Alternating 1Hz electrical stimuli were delivered to parts of the limbic system [anterior and posterior hippocampus, temporal pole, parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), amygdala, anterior (ACG) and posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG), medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OF)]. A total of 40-60 stimuli were averaged in each trial to obtain CCEP responses. CCEP distributions were evaluated by calculating the root mean square (RMS) of CCEP responses. Anterior hippocampal stimulation elicited prominent CCEP responses in medial and lateral temporal structures, PCG, medial OF and insula over the ipsilateral hemisphere. Posterior hippocampal stimulation induced CCEP responses in the ipsilateral medial and lateral temporal structures and PCG. The findings also revealed connections from temporal pole to the ipsilateral medial temporal structures, and connections from PHG to the ipsilateral hippocampus and PCG. The amygdala projected to broad areas including the ipsilateral medial and lateral temporal structures, medial and lateral frontal areas, the cingulate gyrus, insula and inferior parietal lobule. ACG and PCG showed connections to the ipsilateral medial fronto-parietal areas and connections to bilateral medial temporo-parieto-occipital and lateral parieto-occipital areas, respectively. Medial and lateral OF stimulation induced responses in the adjacent cortices. This study revealed that various regions within the limbic network are intimately connected in reverberating circuits and are linked to specific ipsilateral and contralateral regions, which may reflect distinct functional roles.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Click here for full text options,*corticocortical evoked potential [other term],,,

treatment response","Neuromodulative treatment options are warranted in patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsy. However, acquisition of controlled data on deep brain stimulation has so far been achieved only for the centromedian and anterior thalamic nucleus. In a case series of four patients with intractable partial epilepsy, a randomized controlled cross-over protocol was used to get insight into efficacy and safety of 3-month nucleus accumbens stimulation. Seizure frequency, neurocognitive testing, ""Liverpool Seizure Severity Score,"" ""Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory,"" ""Beck Depression Inventory,"" and ""Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview"" were obtained at every visit. In a subsequent open-label phase, nucleus accumbens stimulation responders underwent concomitant anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation, whereas nonresponders received solely thalamic stimulation. Under nucleus accumbens stimulation, three of four patients had >=50% reduction in frequency of disabling seizures without further improvement with additional anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation. Patient-reported outcome and neurocognitive testing remained unchanged. Accumbens stimulation is safe and seems to be a suitable option in intractable partial epilepsy. The current findings require substantiation by an adequately powered multicenter study.Copyright © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2015 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,"anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation [other term]

electroencephalogram","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of anterior thalamic nuclei (ANT) reduces frequency and intensity of epileptic partial and secondarily-generalized seizures. However, exact mechanisms of action and the effects of ANT-DBS on cortical activity are unknown. Recently, we demonstrated in one of our patients who had non-lesional epilepsy the correlation of ANT-DBS with bilateral frontal epileptic patterns (Bucurenciu et al., 2014). We report the case of a 27-years old male epileptic patient with dyscognitive focal seizures, due to a left-hemispheric inoperable lesion, interpreted as focal cortical dysplasia and polymicrogyria, comprising the upper temporal lobe, the insula and the entire parietal lobe. At the age of 25, quadripolar DBS-electrodes (Model 3389, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), connected to a subclavicular dual-channel programmable stimulation device (Activa PC, Medtronic), were stereotactically implanted in both ANTs. The stimulation parameters were 5 V and 5.5 V, 180 Hz, 150 ls pulse width, cycling mode with 1min on/3min off. Stimulation on-phases were identified based on periodical reduction of QRS-complex-amplitudes in electrocardiograms. A 20% reduction of seizure frequencies with no side effects were reported after initiation of ANT-DBS. In several long-term EEGs of the patient, prominent non-specific midline-theta frontal rhythms of uncertain significance were observed during drowsiness. During bilateral stimulation via the most upper (superior-lateral) electrode-contacts (3 and 11) a reliable interruption of midline-theta rhythm was observed in EEGs, density-spectral-arrays and power-spectra, similarly to the effect of activating the patient. When the lowest (inferio-medial) electrode contacts (0 and 8) were used for stimulation the midline-theta rhythm was less affected. Other cortical rhythms, such as occipital-alpha or sleep-spindles, were only unspecifically reduced in amplitude by stimulation of both the most upper and the lowest contact-pairs, respectively. The contact-specificity and the selective inhibition of midline-theta rhythm, associated with changes of the power-spectra shape, prove that the observed EEG-amplitude reduction during stimulation is a real desynchronization of midline-theta rhythm and not an artefact. This is the first direct proof of an acute, electrode-contact specific influence of high-frequency ANT-DBS with standard stimulation-parameters on a cortical rhythm and might be relevant for epilepsies involving frontal cortical regions.",Click here for full text options,,,,

However, the most optimal target for stimulation has not been described in detail. In the present study, we aimed to study the correlation between stimulation site and outcome in order to define the most optimal target for DBS in refractory epilepsy. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 62 contact locations used in 28 treatment attempts in 15 prospectively followed patients with ANTDBS during past 4,5 years were studied. Treatment attempts were classified into responding and non-responding trials using seizure reduction and side effect profile as criteria. The locations of active contacts in each treatment trial were analyzed indirectly using ACPC coordinate system and stereotactic atlas as well as directly using 3T MRI STIR images. Result(s): The contacts in successful treatment trials were located significantly more anterior (3,4mm vs. 1,4 mm ;p <0,001 ) and superior (12,2mm vs. 10,1mm; p < 0,001) in AC-PC coordinate system compared to contacts in non-responding treatment trials. Contacts at area correlating with most frequently overlapped area of ANT models in 3T MRI STIR images were associated with favourable outcome whereas contacts at area suggested by stereotactic atlas were associated with poor outcome. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrates that stimulation site at the anterior aspect of ANT is crucial for favourable therapy outcome. Direct targeting of ANT is superior to indirect targeting method due to high degree of anatomical variation between individuals, and especially, deviation of patient imaging data from stereotactic atlas. Special attention should be paid on selecting contacts properly at ANT for chronic stimulation while avoiding selection of too deep contacts.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Australia","Approximately 25,000 people in Australia are diagnosed with epilepsy each year. Unfortunately seizures can not be adequately controlled in a third of the affected individuals. Modification of dysfunctional electrical brain activity by cathodal- transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) seems to be a potentially valuable non-invasive alternative for epilepsy treatment. This pilot study aimed to assess the effects of a novel protocol called within-session repeated c-tDCS (9 min treatment - 20min rest - 9min treatment) on epileptic patients with focal epilepsy. Nine participants with focal epilepsy participated in this pilot study so far. These participants were recruited from the video-EEG monitoring unit for epileptic patients at The Royal Melbourne Hospital. Seven patients received c-tDCS treatment with a 9-20-9 protocol (9 min: treatment - 20min: rest - 9min: treatment) and two patients received sham tDCS. Intracortical inhibition (ICI) was measured from the primary motor cortex with paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation before and after tDCS treatment. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from first dorsal interosseous muscle in all participants. Participants were asked to record the time and the number of their seizure attacks post tDCS treatment for 4 weeks in a seizure diary. All patients tolerated the c-tDCS protocol very well. The trend of increasing ICI post c-tDCS was seen in all participants except one (P = 0.024). Sham tDCS did not have any effect on the level of ICI in the motor cortex. The number of seizures was reduced by 50-100% in most participants. However in one patient the number of seizures were reduced by only 16%. This pilot study is still in progress. Based on the achieved results so far, it can be concluded that c-tDCS can be a promising noninvasive technique that can be used to control seizure attacks.",Click here for full text options,,,,

pathophysiology","Background: Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment in psychiatry, and the oldest brain stimulation modality. Although it causes a generalized non-focal seizure, its therapeutic benefits are not global but limited to specific clinical syndromes, of which mood disorders are the most common indication. Deficits in reward processing are key to depression, presenting as anhedonia and amotivation. In this study we analyzed the changes in reward circuit dynamics leading to euthymia after ECT. Method(s): We recruited 8 patients with depression undergoing ECT. Before and after an acute course of ECT, patients were scanned in a 3T MRI scanner and we obtained structural, resting state fMRI and diffusion MRI data, in addition to clinical and reward-specific behavioral measures. We analyzed the functional connectivity data using fcFast and SPM8. After standard preprocessing procedures, we identified the VTA and Nucleus Accumbens based on atlas coordinates and calculated whole-brain and ROI-ROI correlations. Result(s): After ECT, we observed changes in connectivity within nodes of the reward network and also with other clinically-relevant systems, including the control, salience and default mode networks. Conclusion(s): Identifying the mechanism of action of our most effective therapies is a priority for our field, as this provides crucial insights into pathophysiology and identifies targets for therapeutic action. In this study we describe changes in connectivity within key disease-relevant nodes and circuits, in patients with depression undergoing ECT. These data highlight the value of this paradigm to identify mechanisms of action, but also possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Intralesional recording with deep electrodes have been documented the presence of the ictal discharge arising inside the lesion. Nevertheless interictal and ictal scalp EEG is poorly informative and non-localizing in a great deal of cases. HH disconnection leads to seizure remission in most cases. Aim of this tudy is to describe the intralesional EEG recordings and to compare them with concomitant scalp EEG and with the previous cases reported in literature. Method(s): We reviewed the medical records of 17 children affected by drug resistant focal epilepsy associated to HH. We recorded intralesional electrical activity during stereo-endoscopic disconnection in three cases and during Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) implantation in one. We also correlated it with the simultaneous scalp-EEG recording. Result(s): Acute intralesional recordings in our cases confirmed the presence of epileptiform abnormalities intermingled with low-voltage activity, mostly on the same side of the HH attachment. Paroxysmal activity recorded inside the HH was always evident. Figure 1. Pre-operative brain MR of patients #2, #3, #4 (A-C). Scalp and contemporary intra-hamartoma EEG recordings (D-F). Patients were anesthetized during the operation A. Brain MR in patient #2: coronal IR sequence showing type 2 hypothalamic hamartoma. B. Brain MR in patient #3: coronal T2-weighted sequence showing type 4 hypothalamic hamartoma. C. Brain MR in patient #4: coronal T2-weighted sequence showing type 2 hypothalamic hamartoma. D. Recording in patient #2: scalp EEG shows slow wave superimposed by fast activity, intra-hamartoma recording shows rare paroxysms of sharp waves with few spikes, on a background of beta activity. E. Recording in patient #3: scalp EEG shows intermittent right central and temporal high amplitude slow waves intermingled with low voltage theta waves, intra-hamartoma recording shows continuous fast activity with very few medium amplitude sharp waves, in brief trains. F. Recording in patient #4: scalp EEG shows theta-beta activity intermingled with infrequent slow waves, intra-hamartoma recording shows recurrent high amplitude sharp waves, intermingled with numerous spikes, on a very low amplitude background activity. Conclusion(s): Mapping of HH epileptogenic activity could be useful to confirm the usefulness of disconnection procedure: recording abnormalities and then disconnecting.

brain depth stimulation","Rationale: Deep brain stimulation of the anterior thalamus is a well studied treatment modality for difficult-to-treat pharmacoresistant epilepsies in European countries (Fisher et al., Epilepsia 2011). In view of a higher rate of depressive and cognitive symptoms changes as reported by patients, further potential targets for intractable partial epilepsy are warranted. Clinical data is summarized of patients with Ncl. accumbens (NAC) stimulation in patients with intractable partial epilepsy. Method(s): Seizure frequency and severity as well as neurocognitive and psychiatric parameters were assessed in nine patients, either during a blinded 3-month on-period (4 patients) or a non-blinded 6-month period (5 patients). Antiepileptic drug medication remained unchanged. Result(s): Five out of nine patients had more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency with NAC-stimulation. Patient-reported outcomes (Beck-test, Mini-International-Neuropsychiatric-Interview, Beck-Depression-Inventory IA and Liverpool-Seizure-Severity-Score) and neuropsychological remained unchanged. Two patients experienced worsening of seizure frequency, which was reversed by reduction of stimulation voltage. Responders had a temporal (2 patients, both are non-responders after resective surgery), frontal (1 patient), fronto-temporal (1 patient), multifocal (1 patient) seizure onset. Non-responders had either bilateral temporal (2 patients), frontal (1 patient) or frontotemporal (1 patient) epilepsy. Conclusion(s): The site of seizure onset zone seems not be a positive predictive factor for efficacy of NAC-stimualtion. Possible candidates for NAC-stimulation are also patients after unsuccessfull resective surgery. The NAC may be a suitable target for electrical stimulation in intractable epilepsy - a result to be confirmed in an adequately powered study.",Click here for full text options,,,,

thalamus","Rationale: For medically refractory focal epilepsy, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) has become an established therapeutic strategy in Europe. Also, DBS of the Ncl. accumbens (NAC) has been shown to be safe and potentially efficacious (Schmitt and Voges et al. Journal of Neurology 2014). However, little is known about the electrophysiological consequences of DBS for both targets, partly because of the lack of appropriate data aquisation. Method(s): We had the opportunity to analyze frequency and location of interictal discharges of five patients treated with NAC-DBS and subsequently three patients with NAC-DBS and NAC-ANT-DBS during a seven day period of long-term monitoring video-eeg-monitoring. These results were compared to baseline before DBS initiation and to seizure outcome after 6 months of chronic DBS. Result(s): Reduction in IEDs frequency was not significant and did not correlate with a seizure reduction in 6-months period (defined as 50% seizure reduction compared with 3-month-baseline period). In two patients (both non-responders in 6-month period) showed a change in IED localisation: one patient with frontal lobe epilepsy had a relative increase in temporal IEDs after ANT-DBS and one patient with temporal lobe epilepsy a relative increase in right temporal IEDs after NAC-DBS. During ANT-NAC-DBS there was no change in IED frequency, IED localisation or 6-month period seizure outcome compared to baseline, NAC-DBS or ANT-DBS. Conclusion(s): DBS changes the irritative zone independent from the location of the epileptogenic zone and of response to this treatment modality. ANT-DBS does not add additional benefit to NAC-DBS responders. Further analysis with higher number of patients are necessary to support these preliminary findings.",Click here for full text options,,,,

PC lesional studies have demonstrated a reduction in kindling rate and prevention of secondary generalization. Additionally, low-frequency (1 Hz) deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the PC suppresses progression of amygdala kindling and expression of generalized seizures in fully kindled rats. The role of the PC in epilepsy models displaying spontaneous seizures is less explored. The aim of this study was to investigate 1) the relationship between PC lesions and seizure occurrence and generalization, and 2) the potential of PC DBS to suppress spontaneous epileptic seizures in a rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy. Method(s): Eight male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent the following protocol: 1) day 0: induction of status epilepticus (SE) by intrahippocampal (IH) injection of kainic acid (KA); 2) day 4 and month 3: structural integrity determination by T2-weighted MRI; 3) month 5: implantation of bilateral recording electrodes in the dentate gyrus and a stimulation electrode in the central piriform cortex / dorsal endopiriform nucleus ipsilateral to the KA lesion (-0.8 AP, 4.9 ML, 9.0-7.75 below bregma); 4) month 6: 4 weeks of continuous video-EEG monitoring (VEM) to document seizure frequency, duration and generalization (Racine stage 1-2 versus stage 3-4-5); 5) month 7: 2 weeks of continuous high-frequency (130 Hz) Poisson-distributed PC DBS followed by a 2-week washout period. Result(s): In 3/8 rats T2 hyperintensities corresponding to PC oedema (MRI day 4) and lesions (MRI month 3, same rats) were found, unilaterally (rat 1 & 2) or bilaterally (rat 7). At least one spontaneous seizure was recorded in all rats during the entire 8-week VEM period. Seizure frequency, duration and generalization during the baseline period are listed in Table 1. Neither unilateral nor bilateral PC lesions were necessary for or prevented seizure occurrence; the 2 rats with unilateral PC lesions showed the highest seizure frequency. Uni- or bilateral lesions did not block seizure generalization. Although rats with PC lesions showed the highest proportion of partial seizures, the majority of seizures were generalized in all rats. Based on the results of the pilot trial (Table 2) it is unlikely (6% chance) that PC DBS strongly reduces seizure frequency or generalization in the majority of rats in the IH KA rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy. Conclusion(s): Neither unilateral nor bilateral PC structural integrity as judged by T2-weighted MRI is critical for seizure occurrence or generalization in the IH KA model. Our preliminary findings suggest that the central PC may not be the ideal target for DBS in this epilepsy model with spontaneous seizures. (Table Presented).",Click here for full text options,,,,

We report our recent, short-term efficacy of DBS on bilateral centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM DBS) in subjects with intractable generalized epilepsyorfocal epilepsy with secondary generalization. Method(s): Eight patients (three men; age range, 24-47years; follow-up between 3 and 11 months) were enrolled for CM DBS in Seoul St. Mary's Hospital (two patients under Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; four with schizencephaly under frequent focal seizures with secondarily generalization; one with a large lesion of FCD in R hemisphere; a patient with cryptogenic generalized epilepsy with frequent atypical absence, hypermotor and tonic seizures). Stimulation was delivered using a continuous, high-frequency Stimulation (130Hz, 90musec pulse width, voltage ranging from 1.5 to 3.0V). Seizure counts were monitored and compared with pre-implantation baseline. Result(s): Comparing to baseline,there was 72.1% mean seizure reduction in all patients. Six among them showed clinically and statistically significant improvement (> 50% seizure reduction). One patient remained seizure free from the start of CM DBS for 6 months. No adverse events could clearly be attributed to stimulation. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary evidence suggests that CM DBS appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment, not only in patients with refractory generalized epilepsy but focal (partial) epilepsy appearing less feasible for resective surgical management. Further controlled study with much larger population should be warranted.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Based on human observations, we formulated a general mechanism for the emergence of ADs. Method(s): We retrospectively analysed spectra of AD time-series and control segments of the resting electrocorticogram (ECoG) in 15 epilepsy patients who underwent cortical stimulation mapping. The observations led to the development of phenomenological models for AD emergence and morphology. Result(s): An analytical relationship exists between the spectrum of the baseline ECoG and the ensuing AD, characterised by 'condensation' of the main baseline spectral cluster, with variable inclusion of higher harmonics of the condensate. Conclusion(s): ADs arise by synchronisation of pre-existing local field potentials, likely through temporary inactivation of inhibitory interneurons from repetitive stimulation-induced depolarization. The appearance of higher harmonics indicates that ADs are further modulated by recurrent feedback, likely from the entrained activity of single units. Significance: For the first time, a putative mechanism is suggested for AD emergence following electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex. Insight is also offered into several empirical observations regarding ADs, detailed in the main text. More generally, a novel conceptual synthesis emerges between the behaviour of electrically-excited cortex and the physics of nonlinearly coupled multi-oscillator systems. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The definitions are still evolving. A detailed clinical evaluation may reveal an accurate syndromic and etiological diagnosis. The recent advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiology have revolutionized the management of children with refractory epilepsy and supplement the clinical evaluation. Genetic and metabolic evaluation may be indicated in selected cases. The rational use of anti-epileptic drugs, epilepsy surgery and dietary therapies are the mainstay in the management.

Electrical stimulation consisted of two series of 20 pulses of 1-ms duration, 0.2-Hz frequency, and 1-mA intensity delivered at each of the 39 insular bipoles. Rates of connectivity were reported whenever a noninsular cortical region was tested by at least ten stimulating/recording electrode pairs in three or more patients Results: Significant CCEPs were elicited in 193 of the 578 (33%) tested connections, with an average latency of 33+/-5 ms. The highest connectivity rates were observed with the nearby perisylvian structures (59%), followed by the pericentral cortex (38%), the temporal neocortex (28%), the lateral parietal cortex (26%), the orbitofrontal cortex (25%), the mesial temporal structures (24%), the dorsolateral frontal cortex (15%), the temporal pole (14%), and the mesial parietal cortex (11%). No connectivity was detected in the mesial frontal cortex or cingulate gyrus. The pattern of connectivity also differed between the five insular gyri, with greater connectivity rate for the posterior short gyrus (49%), than for the middle short (29%), and two long gyri (28 and 33%) Conclusion(s): The human insula is characterized by a rich and complex connectivity that varies as a function of the insular gyrus and appears to partly differ from the efferences described in nonhuman primates.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Click here for full text options,*corticocortical evoked potential [other term],,,

temporal lobectomy","It is surprising that the piriform cortex, when compared to the hippocampus, has been given relatively little significance in human epilepsy. Like the hippocampus, it has a phylogenetically preserved three-layered cortex that is vulnerable to excitotoxic injury, has broad connections to both limbic and cortical areas, and is highly epileptogenic - being critical to the kindling process. The well-known phenomenon of early olfactory auras in temporal lobe epilepsy highlights its clinical relevance in human beings. Perhaps because it is anatomically indistinct and difficult to approach surgically, as it clasps the middle cerebral artery, it has, until now, been understandably neglected. In this review, we emphasize how its unique anatomical and functional properties, as primary olfactory cortex, predispose it to involvement in focal epilepsy. From recent convergent findings in human neuroimaging, clinical epileptology, and experimental animal models, we make the case that the piriform cortex is likely to play a facilitating and amplifying role in human focal epileptogenesis, and may influence progression to epileptic intractability.Copyright © 2014 Vaughan and Jackson.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Methods Randomized multicenter double-blinded controlled trial of responsive focal cortical stimulation (RNS System). Subjects with medically intractable partial onset seizures from one or two foci were implanted, and 1 month postimplant were randomized 1:1 to active or sham stimulation. After the fifth postimplant month, all subjects received responsive stimulation in an open label period (OLP) to complete 2 years of postimplant follow-up. Results All 191 subjects were randomized. The percent change in seizures at the end of the blinded period was -37.9% in the active and -17.3% in the sham stimulation group (p = 0.012, Generalized Estimating Equations). The median percent reduction in seizures in the OLP was 44% at 1 year and 53% at 2 years, which represents a progressive and significant improvement with time (p < 0.0001). The serious adverse event rate was not different between subjects receiving active and sham stimulation. Adverse events were consistent with the known risks of an implanted medical device, seizures, and of other epilepsy treatments. There were no adverse effects on neuropsychological function or mood. Significance Responsive stimulation to the seizure focus reduced the frequency of partial-onset seizures acutely, showed improving seizure reduction over time, was well tolerated, and was acceptably safe. The RNS System provides an additional treatment option for patients with medically intractable partial-onset seizures. © 2014 The Authors.

tonic clonic seizure","In five adult patients with intractable partial epilepsy, safety and feasibility of chronic bilateral electrical stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) were assessed, also providing initial indications of therapeutic efficacy. Concurrent medication remained unchanged. In this phase 1 trial, clinical outcome parameters of interest were Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire (QOLIE-31-P), Beck Depression Inventory, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, neuropsychological testing, and Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale. Those data were obtained after 6 months of NAC stimulation and compared to the equivalent assessments made directly before implantation of electrodes. Additionally, monthly frequencies of simple partial seizures, complex partial seizures (CPS), and generalised tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) were assessed during 3 months before electrode implantation and at the end of 6-month NAC stimulation. Proportion of responders, i.e. >=50 % reduction in frequency of disabling seizures (sum of CPS and GTCS), was calculated. Main findings were unchanged psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment and a significant decrease in seizure severity (p = 0.043). QOLIE-31-P total score trended towards improvement (p = 0.068). Two out of five participants were responders. The median reduction in frequency of disabling seizures was 37.5 %. In summary, we provide initial evidence for safety and feasibility of chronic electrical stimulation of the NAC in patients with intractable partial epilepsy, as indicated by largely unchanged neurocognitive function and psychiatric comorbidity. Even though our data are underpowered to reliably assess efficacy, the significant decrease in seizure severity provides an initial indication of antiictal efficacy of NAC stimulation. This calls for larger and at best randomised trials to further elucidate efficacy of NAC stimulation in patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. © 2014 The Author(s).",Click here for full text options,"Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale [other term]

*vagus nerve stimulation","About one third of patients with epilepsy are refractory to medical treatment. For these patients, alternative treatment options include implantable neurostimulation devices such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and responsive neuro-stimulation systems (RNS). We conducted a systematic literature review to assess the available evidence on the clinical efficacy of these devices in patients with refractory epilepsy across their lifespan. VNS has the largest evidence base, and numerous randomized controlled trials and open-label studies support its use in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1997 for treatment of partial seizures, but has also shown significant benefit in the treatment of generalized seizures. Results in adult populations have been more encouraging than in pediatric populations, where more studies are required. VNS is considered a safe and well-tolerated treatment, and serious side effects are rare. DBS is a well-established treatment for several movement disorders, and has a small evidence base for treatment of refractory epilepsy. Stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus has shown the most encouraging results, where significant decreases in seizure frequency were reported. Other potential targets include the centromedian thalamic nucleus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia structures. Preliminary results on RNS, new-generation implantable neuro-stimulation devices which stimulate brain structures only when epileptic activity is detected, are encouraging. Overall, implantable neurostimulation devices appear to be a safe and beneficial treatment option for patients in whom medical treatment has failed to adequately control their epilepsy. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials are required to provide a sufficient evidence base for the inclusion of DBS and RNS in clinical guidelines.Copyright © 2014 Cox et al.",Click here for full text options,"*implantable neurostimulation device [other term]

seizure","Objective: Extraoperative cortical stimulation (CS) for mapping of eloquent cortex in patients prior to epilepsy surgery is not standardized across centres. Two different techniques are in use, referred to as bipolar and monopolar CS. We compared the ability of bipolar versus monopolar CS to identify eloquent cortex and their safety profile in patients undergoing subdural EEG recordings. Method(s): Five patients undergoing intracranial EEG recordings and extraoperative CS. Systematic comparison of stimulus parameters, clinical signs and afterdischarges of bipolar versus monopolar CS. Result(s): Bipolar CS requires less stimulation current but is more time consuming and more likely to produce afterdischarges when compared to monopolar CS. None of the stimulations elicited seizures. The area defined as eloquent by either bipolar or monopolar CS reveals only minor discordances, involving mainly the outer row and edge of the electrode array producing clinical signs with monopolar CS only. Qualitatively, bi- and monopolar CS reproduced similar movements and types of muscle contractions. Conclusion(s): Bipolar and monopolar CS are safe procedures identifying similar cortical areas as eloquent, although monopolar cortical stimulation is less time consuming. Significance: Findings advocate the use of monopolar CS in a clinical setting. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",Click here for full text options,"*bipolar cortical stimulation [other term]

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has suggested a new definition of epilepsy, for the first time including a definition of epilepsy resolution. Progress in the diagnosis relates to new genetic findings, improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the increasing use of stereo electroencephalograms (sEEG). Regarding treatment there are new clinically relevant data on the pathophysiology and prevention of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Zonisamide has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for monotherapy in adults with focal seizures and combination therapy in children aged >=6 years. Retigabin and perampanel have been approved but are currently taken off the market in Germany (only) because the Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss (GBA, Joint Federal Committee) did not find any additional therapeutic value as compared to lamotrigine due to a lack of data. A decision regarding a new application for perampanel is pending. Regarding surgical treatment novel ablation techniques (e.g. stereotactic radiofrequency and laser ablation as well as focussed ultrasound ablation) and brain stimulation paradigms are under investigation. Experimental studies, generously supported by the European Union (EU) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) are focusing on (opto-)genetic (e.g. using lentoviral transfection), epigenetic (e.g. micro-RNA-related) approaches and on the investigation of neuronal micronetworks. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",Click here for full text options,,,Neues auf dem gebiet der epilepsien.,

tonic clonic seizure / therapy","Medically refractory epilepsy remains a major medical problem worldwide. Although some patients are eligible for surgical resection of seizure foci, a proportion of patients are ineligible for a variety of reasons. One such reason is that the foci reside in eloquent cortex of the brain and therefore resection would result in significant morbidity. This retrospective study reports our experience with a novel neurostimulation technique for the treatment of these patients. We identified three patients who were ineligible for surgical resection of the intracranially identified seizure focus because it resided in eloquent cortex, who underwent therapeutic trial of focal cortical stimulation delivered through the subdural monitoring grid. All three patients had a significant reduction in seizures, and two went on to permanent implantation, which resulted in long-term reduction in seizure frequency. In conclusion, this small case report provides some evidence of proof of concept of the role of targeted continuous neocortical neurostimulation in the treatment of medically refractory focal epilepsy, and provides support for ongoing investigations into this treatment modality.

Results: As seizures ended, extracellular and intracellular recordings showed periodic bursting that progressively decreased in frequency. During the late bursting phase, the duration, number, and rate of occurrence of spikes within single bursts remained constant, whereas cumulative spike amplitude (index of excitation during a burst) and interburst interval (index of inhibition between bursts) progressively increased. The increment of average/cumulative burst excitation and interburst interval toward seizure end was confirmed in human focal seizures recorded with intracerebral electrodes in patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsies. A postburst refractory period of circa 2 seconds that increases with time toward the end of the seizure was confirmed in the experimental model by probing interburst epochs in the CA1 region with local dentate gyrus stimulation just suprathreshold for burst generation.
Interpretation: Our findings support the concept that focal seizures are terminated by the simultaneous and opposing enhancement of excitation (burst activity) in addition to postburst inhibition. We hypothesize that a seizure stops when postburst inhibition becomes large enough to prevent reactivation of excitation
Objective: Comprehension of the events that lead to seizure termination contributes to the development of strategies to confine propagation of ictal discharges. It is commonly assumed that the inhibitory control fails during seizures and recovers after the end of the ictal event. We examine the possibility that a progressive increase of inhibition that counters an increase in the strength of excitation contributes to terminating a focal seizure.Copyright © 2014 American Neurological Association.",Click here for full text options,extracellular recording [other term],,,

In about 15% of these patients, the seizures are not adequately controlled with antiepileptic drugs; such patients are potential candidates for surgical treatment and the major proportion is in the pediatric group (18 years old or less). Epilepsy surgery in children who have been carefully chosen can result in either seizure freedom or a marked (>90%) reduction in seizures in approximately two-thirds of children with intractable seizures. Advances in structural and functional neuroimaging, neurosurgery, and neuroanaesthesia have improved the outcomes of surgery for children with intractable epilepsy. Early surgery improves the quality of life and cognitive and developmental outcome and allows the child to lead a normal life. Surgically remediable epilepsies should be identified early and include temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, lesional temporal and extratemporal epilepsy, hemispherical epilepsy, and gelastic epilepsy with hypothalamic hamartoma. These syndromes have both acquired and congenital etiologies and can be treated by resective or disconnective surgery. Palliative procedures are performed in children with diffuse and multifocal epilepsies who are not candidates for resective surgery. The palliative procedures include corpus callosotomy and vagal nerve stimulation while deep brain stimulation in epilepsy is still under evaluation. For children with >>surgically remediable epilepsy,>> surgery should be offered as a procedure of choice rather than as a treatment of last resort.",Click here for full text options,,,,

vagus nerve stimulation","Neurostimulation is now an established therapy for the treatment of movement disorders, pain, and epilepsy. While most neurostimulation systems available today provide stimulation in an open-loop manner (i.e., therapy is delivered according to preprogrammed settings and is unaffected by changes in the patient's clinical symptoms or in the underlying disease), closed-loop neurostimulation systems, which modulate or adapt therapy in response to physiological changes, may provide more effective and efficient therapy. At present, few such systems exist owing to the complexities of designing and implementing implantable closed-loop systems. This review focuses on the clinical experience of four implantable closed-loop neurostimulation systems: positional-adaptive spinal cord stimulation for treatment of pain, responsive cortical stimulation for treatment of epilepsy, closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation for treatment of epilepsy, and concurrent sensing and stimulation for treatment of Parkinson disease. The history that led to the development of the closed-loop systems, the sensing, detection, and stimulation technology that closes the loop, and the clinical experiences are presented. © 2014 The Author(s).",Click here for full text options,*closed loop neurostimulation system [other term],,,

During presurgical evaluation, intracerebral single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) is performed to define the boundaries of eloquent areas and to evoke seizure-associated symptoms. Extensive intracranial exploration and stimulation generate a large dataset on brain connectivity that can be used to improve EZ detection and to understand the organization of the human epileptic brain. We developed a protocol to analyse field responses evoked by intracranial stimulation. Intracerebral recordings were performed with 105-162 recording sites positioned in fronto-temporal regions in 12 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. Recording sites were used for bipolar SPES at 1 Hz. Reproducible early and late phases (<60 ms and 60-500 ms from stimulus artefact, respectively) were identified on averaged evoked responses. Phase 1 and 2 responses recorded at all and each recording sites were plotted on a 3D brain reconstructions. Based on connectivity properties, electrode contacts were primarily identified as receivers, mainly activators or bidirectional. We used connectivity patterns to construct networks and applied cluster partitioning to study the proprieties between potentials evoked/stimulated in different regions. We demonstrate that bidirectional connectivity during phase 1 is a prevalent feature that characterize contacts included in the EZ. This study shows that the application of an analytical protocol on intracerebral stimulus-evoked recordings provides useful information that may contribute to EZ detection and to the management of surgical-remediable epilepsies. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Click here for full text options,"*epileptogenic zone [other term]

However, only limited knowledge is available regarding the intrainsular connections subserving the complex integrative role of the insular cortex. The aim of this study was to analyze the functional connectivity within- and across-insular subregions, at both gyral and functional levels. Experimental design: We performed intracerebral electrical stimulation in 10 patients with refractory epilepsy investigated with depth electrodes, 38 of which were inserted in the insula. Bipolar electrical stimulation, consisting of two series of 20 pulses of 1-ms duration, 0.2-Hz frequency, and 1-mA intensity, was delivered at each insular contact. For each stimulated insular anatomical region, we calculated a rate of connectivity, reflecting the proportion of other insular contacts, showing significant evoked potentials. Result(s): Statistically significant evoked potentials were recorded in 74% of tested connections, with an average latency of 26 +/- 3 ms. All insular gyri were interconnected, except the anterior and posterior short gyri. Most connections were reciprocal, showing no clear anterior to posterior directionality. No connection was observed between the right and the left insula. Conclusion(s): These findings point to specific features of human insula connectivity as compared to non-Human primates, and remain consistent with the complex integration role devoted to the human insula in many cognitive domains. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

workshop","On April 30th, 2011 the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) held a workshop to identify key problems in recent epilepsy clinical trials and propose approaches to address the barriers that impede development of new therapeutic options for epilepsy. Preliminary recommendations were made for selection criteria for subjects entered into epilepsy trials that maximize the scientific impact of the trial and increase the ability to recruit appropriate subjects efficiently and safely. These recommendations were further refined by the authors following the workshop, and subsequently shared with all NINDS workshop participants and with the participants of the 2011 AED XI workshop on epilepsy trials (approximately 200 participants) for further comment. The working group agreed to a final set of criteria that include updated considerations of subject age, clinical semiology, EEG and imaging results, use of prior and current therapies, co-occurring conditions, and suicidality, among others. © 2014.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Experimental Design: A kainic acid (KA)-induced model of temporal lobe seizure and a penicillin-induced model of neocortical partial seizure were used in this study. Rats of each model were randomly allocated into two groups: control and model groups. The model group was further divided into the KA or penicillin group, sham conduction group and conduction group. The current shunt was realized through the implantation of a customized conduction electrode. After surgery, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for two hours for each rat under anesthesia. Subsequently, the rats were video monitored for 72 h to detect the occurrence of behavioral seizures upon awakening. The average number and duration of seizures on EEG and the number of behavioral seizures were measured. Result(s): In KA model, the number of total EEG seizures in conduction group (9.5+/-2.46) was significantly less than that in sham conduction group (15.13+/-3.45) (p<0.01). The duration of EEG seizures in conduction group (26.13+/-7.81 s) was significantly shorter than that in sham conduction group (34.17+/-7.25 s) (p = 0.001). A significant reduction of behavioral seizures was observed in the conduction group compared with KA (p = 0.000) and sham conduction groups (p = 0.000). In penicillin model, there was a 61% reduction in total EEG seizures in conduction group compared with sham conduction group (p<0.01), and the duration of EEG seizures in conduction group (6.29+/-2.64 s) was significantly shorter than that in the sham conduction group (12.07+/-3.81 s) (p = 0.002). A significant reduction of behavioral seizures was observed in conduction group compared with penicillin (p<0.01) and sham conduction groups (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Current shunt effectively reduces the onset and severity of seizures. Current shunt therapy could be an effective alternative minimally invasive approach for temporal lobe epilepsy and neocortex epilepsy. © 2014 Zhang et al.",Click here for full text options,*neocortical epilepsy / *therapy [other term],,,

The study on stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for epilepsy (SANTE) is so far the only clinical trial to provide class I evidence for the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in partial epilepsy. Stratification of possible responders and potential contraindications are still lacking. Aim. The rationale and the design of a double-blind and an open interventional study protocol for the nucleus accumbens (NAC) as a potential target for DBS in epilepsy are introduced in this article. Material and methods. In both investigation protocols potential psychiatric alterations were collated using the Beck depression inventory (BDI) and the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) as well as cognitive alterations using an extensive epilepsy-specific neurocognitive examination. Additionally the Liverpool seizure severity scale (LSSS) was used to objectify possible alterations in the severity of seizures. Determination of the quality of life was carried out using the quality of life inventory for epilepsy P-31. The patients completed a seizure calendar in which a differentiation was made and documented between simple focal, complex focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The anti-ictal medication for all patients treated with DBS was left unaltered during the investigation period. The minimum requirement for admission to the 6-month interventional study investigation protocol was a seizure frequency of at least one debilitating seizure per month. The randomized controlled investigation protocol had a shorter observation period of only 3 months and required a minimum of three debilitating seizures per month. Results. For the four patients who have so far been recruited into the interventional study protocol there was a tendency towards a reduction of the subjective severity of seizures after 6 months of NAC-DBS (p=0.068). Seizure frequency as well as psychiatric and neurocognitive outcome parameters remained unchanged. Conclusion. These preliminary results suggest that the NAC might represent a suitable target for DBS in partial epilepsy in syndrome-oriented indications for focal epilepsy; however, the small patient numbers and the open design of this protocol warrant higher evidence class studies to confirm the results and identify possible responders and side effects. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",Click here for full text options,"Liverpool seizure severity scale [other term]

tractography","Background. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of refractory epilepsy has officially been approved in Europe since 2010. It is still a matter of debate which forms of focal epilepsy can be treated with DBS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT). Aim. The aim of this study was to use diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography (DTI-FT) to research connectivity of the ANT and adjacent nuclei to other brain regions in patients with implants. Material and methods. A series of eight consecutive patients were treated with ANT DBS after undergoing DTI-FT (3 T and 32 or 61 gradient directions). The ANT DBS was performed stereotactically via a transventricular route and postoperatively, electrode positions were determined with helical computed tomography. The individual contacts of these quadripolar DBS electrodes served as seed regions and tractography was performed from the vicinity of every contact (StealthViz-DTI, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Fiber tracts were spatially mapped and transferred to the ICBM-152 standard brain. Results. More superficially located DBS electrode contacts (located in the ANT or proximity) affected fiber tracts that projected to the temporal or frontal regions. Fiber tracts located deeper projected to the brain stem and from here to the periaqueductal gray matter or the prefrontal cortex. Conclusion. A clinical evaluation is currently not available for implanted patients. The connectivity analysis, however, helps to draw conclusions concerning a possibly improved patient selection for ANT DBS. According to these results, frontal and temporal epilepsies should show a better outcome than other focal epilepsies and under the assumption of direct modulation or recruitable modulated effects an increase of psychiatric complications (e.g. depression) might be expected from the stimulation of deeper electrode contacts. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",Click here for full text options,,,Thalamische zielgebiete fur die tiefe hirnstimulation bei therapierefraktarer epilepsie.

The present study was designed to determine whether there is a crucial period for the treatment of epileptogenesis with LFS. LFS was delivered at different time-points to evaluate its anti-epileptogenic effect on amygdala-kindling rats. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose small-animal positron-emission tomography (microPET) and multi-channel EEG recording (MER) were used to investigate the dynamics of brain networks during epileptogenesis and LFS treatment. Interestingly, LFS delivered in the first 7 days significantly retarded the progression of behavioral seizure stages and shortened the afterdischarge duration (ADD), LFS delivered throughout the whole process resulted in similar effects. However, if LFS was delivered at the beginning of seizure stage 2 or 3 (5 +/- 0.3 days during kindling acquisition), it had no anti-epileptogenic effect and even prolonged the ADD and enhanced synchronization of the EEGs. MicroPET study revealed a notable hypometabolism in the amygdala, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex and other regions in the limbic system during the period from seizure stage 0 to stage 2 or 3. The glucose metabolism in those regions was specifically increased by LFS. MER further verified that an early network of afterdischarge spread was formed in those brain regions during kindling acquisition. Thus, we provided direct evidence that modulation of the early network in the limbic system is crucial for the anti-epileptogenic effect of LFS in amygdaloid-kindling rats. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",Click here for full text options,*low frequency stimulation [other term],,,

In about 15% of these patients, the seizures are not adequately controlled with antiepileptic drugs; such patients are potential candidates for surgical treatment and the major proportion is in the pediatric group (18 years old or less). Epilepsy surgery in children who have been carefully chosen can result in either seizure freedom or a marked (>90%) reduction in seizures in approximately two-thirds of children with intractable seizures. Advances in structural and functional neuroimaging, neurosurgery, and neuroanaesthesia have improved the outcomes of surgery for children with intractable epilepsy. Early surgery improves the quality of life and cognitive and developmental outcome and allows the child to lead a normal life. Surgically remediable epilepsies should be identified early and include temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, lesional temporal and extratemporal epilepsy, hemispherical epilepsy, and gelastic epilepsy with hypothalamic hamartoma. These syndromes have both acquired and congenital etiologies and can be treated by resective or disconnective surgery. Palliative procedures are performed in children with diffuse and multifocal epilepsies who are not candidates for resective surgery. The palliative procedures include corpus callosotomy and vagal nerve stimulation while deep brain stimulation in epilepsy is still under evaluation. For children with ""surgically remediable epilepsy,"" surgery should be offered as a procedure of choice rather than as a treatment of last resort.",Click here for full text options,extratemporal epilepsy / surgery [other term],,,

brain depth stimulation","Introduction: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) has been approved for the treatment of selected patients suffering from epilepsy refractory to medical therapy. Both the surgical approach and the optimal site for stimulation are controversial. Method(s): In 13 patients (9 female; median age 34) an extraventricular approach was used for bilateral electrode implantation in general anaesthesia. The junction of the mamillothamic tract with the ANT was targeted. Implantation of the permanent electrode was preceded by microelectrode recordings from a single trajectory. The stereotactic position of active contacts was derived from intraoperative computed tomography and analyzed by two different applications. First, a propriatory software tool served to determine the position of different electrode contacts with regard to the ANT as delineated in the Mai atlas. Second, an open source-based stereotactic software tool was developed to analyze the position of different electrode contacts with respect to the mammillothalamic tract and thalamus. To this end, both structures had been individually segmented from preoperative MRI using a free application (ITKSnap). Result(s): For 11 patients, mean and median follow-up was 20 months. Two patients were excluded from this analysis, since their follow-up period was shorter than 6 months. A significant reduction of seizures was observed in 9 patients. Partial seizures were reduced by >75% in five patients and from 50 to 75% in four patients. Secondary generalization, if present, was reduced to at least the same extent. Furthermore, seizure duration and severity were also reduced. Two patients were rated as non-responders (seizure reduction <30%). Surgery-related complications, such as intracranial hemorrhages or infections, were not observed. Intraoperative microelectrode recordings revealed a typical pattern consisting of abundant bursting activity upon entering the thalamus which was followed by a silent segment of approximately 2 mm and the recurrence of sparse neuronal activity. The silent region was supposed to represent the transition from the thalamus to fiber structures, i.e. the mammillothalamic tract and/or the internal medullary lamina. Segmentation of the course of the mammillothalamic tract and the boundaries of the thalamus from preoperative MRI revealed a significant degree of individual as well as interhemispheric variation. Permanent stimulation was commenced and continued with contacts located in proximity to or within the mammillothalamic tract, and several of these contacts had been placed below the ANT proper. Since seizure suppression elicited by individual contacts or stimulation settings had to be assessed over months in order to draw reliable conclusions, a systematic evaluation of each contact with different settings is impracticable in epilepsy. However, the efficacy of the chosen contacts was corroborated by the fact that in several patients the stimulation amplitude could be lowered over time resulting in even improved seizure suppression. Conclusion(s): 'ANT stimulation' performed by targeting of the upper end of the mammillothalamic tract using an extraventricular trajectory is a safe and effective approach. Based on 3D analysis of the anatomy of individual patients and respective electrode positions effective stimulation does not require placement of active contacts within the ANT proper. As for well-established DBS targets in movement disorder surgery fiber tracts are likely to mediate therapeutic effects.",Click here for full text options,,,,

However stimulation of the anterior thalamus is associated with increased complaints of memory impairment and depression. First results are presented, which assess efficacy and safety of chronic electrical stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) - a putative new target for patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. Method(s): Following a 3-month baseline period, all subjects (5 patients) underwent bilateral NAC stimulation for 6 months. Antiepileptic drugs remained unchanged throughout the study. Outcomes of interest were changes in median frequency of disabling seizures (sum of complex partial and generalized tonic clonic seizures) and proportion of responders (>= 50 % reduction of seizure frequency), also patient outcome questionnaires (Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale [LSSS], Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire [QOLIE-31-P] and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-IA]), psychiatric assessment by Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and extensive neuropsychological testing were assessed prior to electrode implantation and after 6 months of NAC stimulation. Result(s): Two out of five participants were responders. The median reduction in frequency of disabling seizures was 37.5%. NAC stimulation resulted in significant decrease in seizure severity as assessed with LSSS (p = 0.043). QOLIE-31-P total score trended towards improvement (p = 0.068), whereas BDI IA-scores, M.I.N.I. and neuropsychological test scores remained unchanged. Conclusion(s): In patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy, chronic electrical stimulation of the NAC may be effective as indicated by median reduction in seizure frequency and decreased seizure severity. NAC stimulation leaves neurocognitive function and psychiatric comorbidity unchanged.",Click here for full text options,,,,

brain depth stimulation","Objective: To assess the neurological deficit associated with the surgical resection of brain lesions that involve the eloquent cortex using brain stimulation and without it in order to achieve wider resections with safer margins. Material(s) and Method(s): Follow-up to 3 groups of patients with brain injury related to the premotor eloquent area was made; the first group, 10 patients who underwent resection of the lesion with standard anesthetic technique, intra operative cortical stimulation with Ossiris stimulator and neuropsychological protocol; the second group, brain stimulationwas performed in 4 patients through intracraneal electrodes to identify and avoid injury to eloquent areas. Other group of patients had to be put under general anesthesia without muscle relaxation. Follow-up at 3 months was performed to assess neurological deficit. Initial and monitoring data were recorded and monitored in an Excel 2010 database for further statistical analysis. Result(s): In the cortical stimulation group, complete resection of the lesion was achieved in 58% of patients. In the follow-up visit 3 months after surgery, 76% of patients had no neurological deficit associated with the procedure, 72% of patients with initial clinical presentation was focal seizures were in Enguel I. Discussion(s): Cortical stimulation has been developed as an increasingly useful tool for resection of eloquent lesions as it opens up the possibility of using it not only to establish a real-time functional map of the cerebral cortex that allows the surgeon to define a safe edge for resection of those lesions. Our results support the usefulness of this tool. Conclusion(s): Cortical stimulation for resection of brain lesions in eloquent areas is a good tool to preserve neurological function. Moreover, the preoperative cortical stimulation of intra lesion and intracranial electrodes in epilepsy surgery is highly useful to verify location of epileptogenic focus.",Click here for full text options,,,Estimulacion cortical directa: Un herramienta en reseccion de lesiones cerebrales relacionadas con areas elocuentes.,

market","The last 20-30 years has seen the development of new generation of antiepileptic drugs, with more than 15 products reaching the market. These new drugs provide a much wider range of treatment options for patients, and some have proven advantages over standard treatments with respect to adverse effects and pharmacokinetics. However, there is little evidence that these new drugs have had an impact on longer term patient outcomes as 30-40 % of patients continue to have seizures despite optimum treatment. This may not be surprising given the heterogeneity of epilepsy with respect to aetiology and the fact that current drugs are 'anti-seizure' and have no known effect on the underlying biology of epilepsy. It is important therefore to reflect on antiepileptic drug development paradigms and consider how the next step change in antiepileptic treatment might emerge. Six scenarios will be considered in this presentation, which include strategies to use existing treatments more efficiently as well as the development of new drugs. Most scenarios look at a quite distant horizon. 1. Continued development of anti-seizure drugs. A number of potential new drugs are in development using long standing paradigms. Trials are mainly in patients with refractory focal epilepsy. It is unlikely that such drugs will have a significant impact on patient outcomes. 2. Stratified medicine: efficacy. Significant resource is being spent through international collaborations and consortia to try and identify biomarkers (genetic and others) for seizure outcomes with existing antiepileptic drug treatments. Such biomarkers would allow identification of the most effective drug for an individual. 3. Stratified medicine: safety. Genetic biomarkers have already been identified for severe skin hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine in Asians and Caucasians. Similar developments may prevent the occurrence of a range of serious adverse effectswith a range of drugs. 4. Antiepileptic and disease modifying treatments. We urgently need treatments that influence the underlying biology of epilepsy. These would prevent the development of epilepsy following brain trauma, or alter brain biology once epilepsy has occurred to remove the propensity to unprovoked seizures. Drug targets include inflammatory pathways. Progress is challenged by our continued lack of understanding of the basic biology of the epilepsies, and challenges in trial design. 5. Drug transporter blockers. The drug transporter hypothesis suggests that antiepileptic drugs are pumped away from the epileptogenic zone, although the importance of this hypothesis is still not satisfactorily proven. Drugs that block drug transporters might improve antiepilepetic drug efficacy. 6. Brain stimulation. Vagus nerve and deep brain stimulation are accepted treatments for refractory epilepsy.

Method(s): We performed bilateral anterior thalamic Deep brain stimulation surgery in 5 patients with intractable focal onset epilepsy who were not candidates for resective surgery. Result(s): The median age was 27 years with epilepsy duration of 17 years with seizure frequency ranging from 7/month to 60/month. All of the n five patients had intractable complex partial epilepsy without clear EEG localization or localized lesions on MRI and had been evaluated and refused resective surgery earlier. All patients have more than 6 months of follow up. Of the five patients two patients became seizure free in over 6 months of follow up one patient has occassional seizures and two had 60% seizure reduction. All patients achieved more than 50% seizure reduction with mean 90 seizure reduction and 40% became seizure free.

Bilateral stimulation of the AN of the thalamus is useful for some patients with medically refractory partial seizure, while the efficacy of bilateral CM nucleus stimulation in generalized forms of epilepsy has been recently identified.DESIGN/METHODS:We retrospectively reviewed the records of 4 patients from the Mayo Clinic DBS Program database with medically refractory epilepsy who underwent bilateral AN and CM DBS. Two patients were admitted to Epilepsy Monitor Unit for further DBS programming based on their EEG recording results. RESULT(S):One male and three female patients with median age of 14 years (range 5-19 years) at surgery underwent DBS. Median duration of epileptic history was 11 years (range 4-18 years). All patients recuperated well from the surgical procedure and post-operative MRI documented that all electrodes were correctly located. Average postoperative follow-up was 16 months (range 13-18 months). The average seizure frequency reduction was 63 percent. One patient had been seizure free for 12 months. Additionally, one patient experienced wound dehiscence requiring revision of the generator; otherwise no complications occurred. CONCLUSION(S):These findings suggested that bilateral stimulation of the AN and CM of the thalamus could potentially reduce seizures in medically refractory epilepsy patients who were either refractory to vagus nerve stimulation, or not candidates for resective surgery. DBS programming based on EEG recording results in Epilepsy Monitor Unit is useful for seizure management.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): Six male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with neocortical and hippocampal electrodes. The animals were submitted to hippocampal low- and high-frequency stimulation. Result(s): Recruiting responses were seen in the ipsilateral hippocampus after unilateral low-frequency (6 Hz) hippocampal stimulation with low voltage (0.3 V). These recruiting responses could be seen at the contralateral hippocampus with slightly higher voltage (0.5 V) and over the ipsilateral neocortex with stimulation with 1.2 V. Bilateral neocortical recruiting responses were noted at stimuli voltage of 1.5 V. There were no recruiting responses after high-frequency stimulation (130 Hz). A dorsal column (DC) shift, characterized by baseline oscillation without brain activity modification, was noted in all animals after hippocampal stimulation with frequency higher than 60 Hz. The increase of stimulation frequency from 6 to 130 Hz (1.2 V, 300 musec) showed progressive reduction in the amplitude and disappearance of the time-locked recruiting responses, especially from around 60 Hz. Conclusion(s): Bilateral hippocampal and cortical recruiting responses were easily obtained in all animals after low-frequency hippocampal unilateral stimulation. High-frequency stimulation did not give rise to recruiting response, although a DC shift was noted. The fact that unilateral hippocampal stimulation might lead to bilateral limbic system modulation suggested that unilateral stimulation might be enough in many situations. Our findings suggested that high-frequency stimulation was more likely to be effective than low-frequency stimulation regarding the potential inactivation of the hippocampus. These findings might prove relevant to the determination of the adequate parameters for stimulation using hippocampal deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the future. An increase in our knowledge on the physiologic mechanisms underlying DBS might be translated into more rational clinical approaches. © 2012 International Neuromodulation Society.",Click here for full text options,,,,

These include novel surgical techniques to intervene in motor and cognitive sequelae of refractory epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and certain psychiatric conditions. To a large extent, much of the innovation in our field continues to be driven by a systems-level understanding of the impact of disease on the brain. For example, several groups have exploited findings from neuroimaging work to identify a number of new potential neuromodulatory targets for the treatment of refractory depression. Ongoing discoveries at the cellular and molecular level promise targeted gene or drug delivery aimed at curing disease. Neurosurgeons will certainly remain at the forefront of translating these strategies into practical clinical applications. Several randomized trials are now underway to assess the safety and efficacy of a number of new approaches, and we will continue to acquire better knowledge of optimal patient selection, identification of the most effective neuromodulatory targets, and recognition of adverse effects as these studies progress. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",Click here for full text options,"dorsal column stimulation [other term]

Primidone and propranolol are considered effective, first-line agents for treating ET, while atenolol, alprazolam and topiramate are considered second-line agents. Gabapentin appears to improve ET when used as a monotherapy, although not as an adjunct therapy. Alternatives to pharmacologic treatment for refractory ET include botulinum toxin A injections, deep-brain stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus and thalamotomy. Future developments in the treatment of ET will depend on valid animal models and a greater understanding of its pathophysiology. © 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.",Click here for full text options,,,,"Abbott [United States]

Although millions of people worldwide are affected by ET, only one medication, propranolol, is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat it. None of the medications currently used as ET therapy were developed specifically for this purpose, and select antihypertensive and antiepileptic medications remain at the forefront of ET therapy. Propranolol and primidone are considered ""effective"" agents that treat ET; topiramate, atenolol, and alprazolam are ""probably effective"", and nimodipine, nadolol, and clonazepam are ""possibly effective"". Medications that probably do not adequately treat ET include levetiracetam and pregabalin. Gabapentin appears to improve ET when used as monotherapy, but not when used as adjunct therapy. Sotalol has been found to be ""probably effective"" in treating ET in previous reviews, but it may be associated with arrhythmias and should not be routinely recommended. Botulinum toxin A may reduce limb tremor, but may cause dose dependent weakness. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the VIM is used as an alternative to pharmacological therapy of ET in patients who fail to adequately respond to medical therapy. The magnitude of effect from DBS is greater than from medical management, but more severe side effects are possible with surgery. Future treatment options for ET will depend on valid animal models, and a better understanding of its pathophysiology. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Click here for full text options,"gamma knife thalamotomy [other term]

SRSE is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Protocols for the management of SRSE have been proposed, but restricted clinical trial data compromises the ability to develop a comprehensive critical care treatment paradigm. The majority of the published literature relates to anecdotal reports, case series, reviews and opinion. The objective of this review is to consolidate the knowledge of the treatment of SRSE and develop a management paradigm providing a clear clinical guide ro future clinical management and clinical trials.",Click here for full text options,*super refractory status epilepticus / *diagnosis / *drug therapy / *surgery / *therapy [other term],,,

However, robust localization of crucial functional areas is required. OBJECTIVE(S): To establish a simple, short fMRI task that reliably localizes crucial language areas in individual patients who undergo respective surgery. METHOD(S): fMRI was measured during an 8-minute auditory semantic decision task in 28 healthy controls and 35 consecutive patients who had focal epilepsy or a brain tumor. Nineteen underwent resective surgery. Group and individual analyses were performed. Results in patients were compared with postsurgical language outcome and electrocortical stimulation when available. RESULT(S): fMRI activations concordant with the anterior and posterior language areas were found in 96% and 89% of the controls, respectively. The anterior and posterior language areas were both activated in 93% of the patients. These results were concordant with electrocortical stimulation results in 5 patients. Transient postsurgical language deficits were found in 2 patients in whom surgery was performed in the vicinity of the fMRI activations or who had postsurgical complications implicating areas of fMRI activations. CONCLUSION(S): The proposed fast fMRI language protocol reliably localized the most relevant language areas in individual subjects. It appears to be a valuable complementary tool for surgical planning of epileptogenic foci and of brain tumors.

Methods A combined process of extra-operative electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) mapping, direct ECS and intra-operative continuous language assessment was performed during complicated operative cases. Of the 24 epilepsy patients, nine had a complex relationship between the seizure onset zone and the language cortices. The combined process was used in these nine patients. In the other 15 patients, surgical resection was completed based on extra-operative ECS results alone. Evaluations were performed before and after surgery to assess language function and seizure control. Results The intra-operative continuous language assessment provided important information at the time of the resection. Seven extra-operative ECS positive language sites were resected without obvious language deficits in two patients. Resection was interrupted by language disturbances in an area where no extra-operative ECS positive site was identified in one patient. In three other patients, functional boundary was undefined in extra-operative ECS result, epileptogenic cortices were maximally resected during the continuous language assessment. In terms of seizure control, 18 of 24 (75%) patients reached Engel's class I, including all nine patients who underwent intra-operative continuous language assessment. One patient had minor surgery-related language deficits three months after resection. Conclusions Intra-operative continuous language assessment proved to be complementary to extra-operative ECS mappings. The combination of ECS mappings and intra-operative continuous language assessment can maximise the resection of epileptogenic cortices and preserve language function in difficult cases involving the language cortex. © 2013 British Epilepsy Association.",Click here for full text options,*electrical cortical stimulation mapping [other term],,,

Face categorization was interfered by electrical stimulation but was restored by increasing the visual signal. More importantly, face-categorization interference by electrical stimulation was confined to face-selective electrodes, and the amount of interference was positively correlated with the sensitivity of the face-selective electrodes. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the face-selective area has a direct causal link to face perception. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,*face perception [other term],,,

*task performance","Objective: We measured the spatial, temporal and developmental patterns of gamma activity augmented by picture- and auditory-naming tasks and determined the clinical significance of naming-related gamma-augmentation. Method(s): We studied 56 epileptic patients (age: 4-56. years) who underwent extraoperative electrocorticography. The picture-naming task consisted of naming of a visually-presented object; the auditory-naming task consisted of answering an auditorily-presented sentence question. Result(s): Naming-related gamma-augmentation at 50-120. Hz involved the modality-specific sensory cortices during stimulus presentation and inferior-Rolandic regions during responses. Gamma-augmentation in the bilateral occipital and inferior/medial-temporal regions was more intense in the picture-naming than auditory-naming task, whereas that in the bilateral superior-temporal, left middle-temporal, left inferior-parietal, and left frontal regions was more intense in the auditory-naming task. Patients above 10. years old, compared to those younger, showed more extensive gamma-augmentation in the left dorsolateral-premotor region. Resection of sites showing naming-related gamma-augmentation in the left hemisphere assumed to contain essential language function was associated with increased risk of post-operative language deficits requiring speech therapy (p< 0.05). Conclusion(s): Measurement of gamma-augmentation elicited by either naming task was useful to predict postoperative language deficits. Significance: A smaller degree of frontal engagement in the picture-naming task can be explained by no requirement of syntactic processing or less working memory load. More extensive gamma-augmentation in the left dorsolateral-premotor region in older individuals may suggest more proficient processing by the mature brain. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",Click here for full text options,"*auditory naming task [other term]

In the past 5years new antiepileptic drugs have been approved for clinical use. Some of these drugs have unique, novel mechanisms of action. Overall efficacy of these agents, however, seems similar to other antiepileptic drugs. Vagus nerve stimulation is a well-established palliative therapy for medically resistant epilepsy. Neurostimulation, with newer devices and targets becoming available, is a rapidly expanding field in epileptology. Considerable development and research are still necessary before these newer techniques become the standard of care for the treatment of epilepsy. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,potiga

Two large pivotal trials have recently been completed, one using bilateral anterior thalamic stimulation and another employing closed loop responsive therapy of the brain. These are potential additions to the therapeutic options for neurostimulation in addition to already approved vagus nerve stimulation. This review will address the principles of the various types of neurostimulation, the results of the pivotal trials and the important considerations for interpreting the results of these trials which differ from trials of antiepileptic drugs. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,"anterior thalamic stimulation [other term]

This is the first time that the effects of CM stimulation on interictal focal paroxysmal activity have been observed in humans using depth recordings.

tonic clonic seizure","The most avid goal for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) development today is to discover potential agents to prevent epilepsy or slow the process of epileptogenesis. Accumulating evidence reveals that gap junctions in the brain may be involved in epileptogenesis. Meclofenamic acid (MFA), a gap junction blocker, has not yet been applied in epileptogenic models to test whether it has antiepileptogenic or disease-modifying properties or not. In this study, we investigated the effects of MFA on limbic epileptogenesis in amygdaloid kindling and hippocampus rapid kindling models in mice. We found that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v., 2. mul) administration of either dose of MFA (100. muM, 1. mM or 100. mM) 15. min prior daily kindling stimulus decreased seizure stage, shortened the after-discharge duration (ADD) and increased the number of stimulations required to elicit stage 5 seizure. MFA also prevented the establishment of post-kindling enhanced amygdala excitability, evident as the increase of afterdischarge threshold (ADT) compared with pre-kindling values. Furthermore, MFA retarded kindling acquisition in mice hippocampus rapid kindling model as well, which demonstrated that the antiepileptogenic effects of MFA were not specific to the amygdala but also occur in other limbic structures such as the hippocampus. Our results confirm that MFA can slow the limbic epileptogenesis in both amygdaloid kindling and hippocampus rapid kindling models, and indicate that MFA may be a potential drug that has antiepileptogenic or disease-modifying properties. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Click here for full text options,,,,

vagus nerve stimulation","Surgical treatment for epilepsy has made tremendous strides in the past few decades as a result of advances in neurodiagnostics-particularly structural and functional neuroimaging-and improved surgical techniques. This has not only resulted in better outcomes with respect to epileptic seizures and quality of life, and reduced surgical morbidity and mortality, but it has also increased the population of patients now considered as surgical candidates, particularly in the pediatric age range, and enhanced cost-effectiveness sufficient to make surgical treatment available to countries with limited resources. Yet surgical treatment for epilepsy remains arguably the most underutilized of all accepted medical interventions. In the United States, less than 1% of patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy are referred to epilepsy centers.Although the number of epilepsy surgery centers has increased appreciably over the past two decades, the number of therapeutic surgical procedures performed for epilepsy has not increased at all. For patients who are referred, the average delay from onset of epilepsy to surgery is more than 20 years-too late for many to avoid a lifetime of disability or premature death. Not only has there been no consistent message to convince neurologists and primary care physicians to refer patients for surgery, but the increase in epilepsy surgery centers in the United States has appeared to result in a divergence of approaches to surgical treatment. Efforts are still needed to further improve the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment, including the identification of biomarkers that can reliably determine the extent of the epileptogenic region; however, the greatest benefits would derive from increasing access for potential surgical candidates to epilepsy surgery facilities. Information is needed to determine why appropriate surgical referrals are not being made. Consensus conferences are necessary to resolve controversies that still exist regarding presurgical evaluation and surgical approaches. Standards should be established for certifying epilepsy centers as recommended by the Institute of Medicine's report on epilepsy. Finally, the epilepsy community should not be promoting epilepsy surgery per se but instead emphasize that epilepsy centers do more than epilepsy surgery, promoting the message: All patients with disabling pharmacoresistant seizures deserve evaluation by specialists at epilepsy centers who can provide a variety of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic services. © American Epilepsy Society.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Its minimal risk, excellent tolerability and increasingly sophisticated ability to interrogate neurophysiology and plasticity make it an enviable technology for use in pediatric research with future extension into therapeutic trials. While adult trials show promise in using TMS as a novel, non-invasive, non-pharmacologic diagnostic and therapeutic tool in a variety of nervous system disorders, its use in children is only just emerging.

neurologic disease","Introduction: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases. The diagnosis of epilepsy is currently based on clinical history together with EEG recordings. However, low sensitivity is a major disadvantage of the standard EEG recording. Therefore, patients with unclassified spells often undergo multiple EEG registrations before a diagnosis and treatment plan can be made. To increase the sensitivity of the EEG, it would be beneficial to be able to provoke the occurrence of epileptiform activity in the EEG. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method that can be used to stimulate parts of the human brain. It is now possible to record TMS and EEG simultaneously. In this way, the changes in brain activity induced by TMS can be recorded with EEG. Objective(s): We are going to investigate the possibility to induce epileptiform activity with TMS in patients with epilepsy. We expect to see abnormal discharges on TMS-EEG and we expect that these findings are of diagnostic and localizing value for epilepsy patients. Material(s) and Method(s): 10 healthy volunteers and 30 patients (10 focal epilepsy, 10 generalized epilepsy, 10 cortical dysplasia patients) will be studied. Single pulse TMS will be performed at an intensity of the resting motor threshold. In total, 16 pulses will be delivered at the standard electrode positions according to the 10- 20 system. After eight stimuli at each position, the EEG responses are averaged. If no response is seen, the stimulation intensity will be increased. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): Preliminary results and conclusions will be presented at the conference.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Bilateral stimulation of the anterior nuclei (AN) of the thalamus is useful for some patients with medically refractory partial seizure, while the efficacy of bilateral centromedian (CM) nucleus stimulation in generalized forms of epilepsy has been recently identified. We report on the outcome after thalamic AN and CM DBS in five patients with medically refractory seizures. Method(s): Four patients with medically refractory partial and generalized seizures and one patient with continuous spike wave status (CSWS) during sleep were studied. All patients were either not candidates for resective surgery or refractory to the treatment of vagus nerve stimulation and/or resection surgery. All cases underwent bilateral AN and CM thalamic DBS. In order to optimize the DBS programming for seizure management, three patients were admitted to the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) for quantification of seizures after DBS implantation and additional DBS programming based on their EEG recording results. Result(s): Post-operative MRI documented that all electrodes were correctly located. There was no morbidity or mortality. The average seizure frequency reduction in the four epilepsy patients was 63 percent (range 50 - 80%). EEG revealed that the spike-wave index was decreased from 90% to 50% in the patient with CSWS. Increased attention level was seen in all patients. Additionally, cognition and mood were stable or improved in all cases. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that Bilateral stimulation of the AN and CM of the thalamus reduces seizures. DBS programming based on EEG recording results is useful for seizure management.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): Through a comprehensive search of the Medical Index and EEG reports, all patients with ESES seen at the Mayo Clinic from 2007-2009 were identified. Their charts were reviewed to identify patients who underwent focal cortical resection and the outcome thereof. Result(s): Three patients were identified. Patient #1 had a history of perinatal intraventricular hemorrhage, shunted hydrocephalus, right hemiparesis and global delay. She developed focal and secondarily generalized epilepsy at age 2 years. Overnight EEG revealed ESES with multifocal discharges maximal over the parieto-occipital regions. Regression occurred at age 5 years and she was diagnosed with Continuous Spike Wave in Sleep Syndrome (CSWS). She did not respond to numerous medication trials and deep brain stimulation. She also had seizures recorded from the left frontotemporal region. She underwent left temporal lobectomy at age 7. She continues to take levetiracetam and diazepam with remission of seizures, but she is still in ESES. Patient #2 had a history of perinatal infarct, hydrocephalus, VP shunt, right mesial temporal sclerosis, and global developmental delay. He developed focal and secondarily generalized epilepsy at age 2 years arising from the right mesial temporal lobe. Developmental regression occurred at age 10 years. Overnight EEG revealed ESES with generalized and focal right frontal discharges and he was diagnosed with CSWS. He did not respond to diazepam. He underwent right temporal lobectomy at age 11 with remission of ESES. He is on lamotrigine with rare breakthrough seizures. Patient #3 had no prior epilepsy risk factors. She developed focal epilepsy including focal status epilepticus at age 3 years arising from the right temporal region. Developmental regression occurred at age 4 years. Overnight EEG revealed ESES with generalized discharges maximal over the right temporal region and she was diagnosed with Landau Kleffner Syndrome (LKS). She did not respond to multiple medical therapies. SISCOM and intracranial monitoring revealed right temporal ictal focus. She underwent right parietal resection at age 6. She is currently in remission of ESES and seizures on levetiracetam. Conclusion(s): CSWS and LKS are rare but treatable seizure syndromes of childhood characterized by developmental regression and electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES). At present, the pathophysiology of ESES is unknown. However, in some cases, ESES may be caused by a focal cortical lesion. Focal cortical resection should be considered in CSWS or LKS patients with focal seizures of known or unknown etiology who have not responded to medications.",Click here for full text options,,,,

However, depression was reported as one adverse event. The nucleus accumbens (NAC) has an important relais function for frontal and temporal lobe circuitry; DBS of the NAC has successfully been applied for major depression. The following uncontrolled, observational, open study summarizes the clinical outcome of 6 months of DBS in the NAC. Method(s): Sequential NAC and ANT stimulation for pharmacoresistant patients with focal epilepsy was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Magdeburg. The first period included 6 months of NAC stimulation, the second period ANT stimulation, respectively. Already 6 months before surgery, the antiepileptic drug regimen remained unchanged. All patients underwent video-eeg-monitoring before surgery and after the 6 month stimulation period. Changes of Beck-test-score, Liverpool-Seizure-Severity-Scale (LSSS) and seizure frequency were prospectively assessed. Due to pronounced interindividual heterogeneity in the baseline period, all variables were related to the individual baseline values and expressed as fraction of 1. The results of four patients, who have completed the first NAC stimulation period, are reported. Result(s): After NAC stimulation the relative LSSS reduced to 0.81 +/- 0.11 (p = 0.014). The sum of disabling seizures (defined as generalized tonic-clonic seizures plus complex partial seizures) showed a tendency toward reduction (0.66 + /- 0.34; p = 0.091). The number of non-disabling seizures and the Beck-test did not change after the NAC stimulation period. From the four subjects, in two patients frequency of disabling seizures reduced to <59% and only the responder (reduction to 22%) had a diffuse electroencephalographic seizure onset pattern. Conclusion(s): NAC stimulation proofed to be efficacious concerning seizure severity. A larger cohort is necessary to show a potential reduction of seizure frequency or the electrophysiological characteristics of responders.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): We investigated 4 PAtients with refractory focal epilepsy and Deep Brain Stimulation of the ANT (all patients were repetitively stimulated with 5 V, ON Time 1 min, OFF Time 5 min) with polysomnographic recordings. Their medical histories will be briefly discussed, also their outcome on DBS therapy; MRI Data will be shown, visualizing the exact position of the electrode in the Tractus mamillothalamicus. Exemplaric PSG data of all patients will be discussed, in order to show the time locked effect of the single DBS activation on Arousel, Sleep Stage and Sleep Discontinuation. Thereafter hypnogramms of all patients are presented in order to show the effect of the continuated DBS activity on sleep quality and structure over the whole night. IN 1 Patient we switched off the DBS in a second PSG night in order to obtain a clearer comparison in one other patient we reduced the DBS power on 2.5 V in a second PSG night. Also these data will be discussed. Result(s): In all four patients we saw a strong effect of DBS on sleep with Induced Arousel, Awakenings and Sleep Discontinuation in 80, 72, 54 and 30% of DBS Activations, together with a high sleep fragmentation in all patients and a decline of deep sleep N3 in two patients. Reducing the DBS power on 2.5 V let to a clear reduction of these effects, switching off DBS stopped them. Conclusion(s): DBS of the ANT leads to sleep fragmentation. This might be the reason for DBS - side effects as mood disorder, memory problems or even seizure continuation. Reducing DBS power at nighttime could be helpfull.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Objective(s): We investigated the effectiveness of seizure reduction after anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) stimulation in patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus. Method(s): Patients included in this study had poorly controlled seizures, despite anticonvulsant medication, and were not candidates for surgical resection of an identifiable seizure focus. Fifteen patients with medically refractory epilepsy underwent the placement of bilateral DBS electrodes in the anterior thalamus. The seizure frequency was monitored and compared with the preimplantation baseline. Result(s): The treatment demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the seizure frequency, with a mean reduction of 70.4% (mean follow-up, 27 months). Two of the patients had a remarkable reduction of seizure frequency. Conclusion(s): It seems to be important that the short-term outcome of ATN DBS reflects the long-term outcome directly. The correlation between the seizure type, characteristics and anticonvulsant effects of ATN DBS did not exhibit significance because of the small number of cases. Therefore, a longer-term follow-up with a larger group of patients is required to fully evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this treatment modality. © 2012 S.

Wistar rats (n = 15) were implanted with an electrode-cannula complex in the CA3 area, stimulation and recording electrodes in the subiculum and another recording electrode at the contralateral motor cortex. Two weeks later rats were injected repeatedly with KA (0.05 mug/0.1 muL) for 3 days with an interval of 48 h. HFS (125 Hz, 100 musec) was delivered to the subiculum at a predetermined intensity range (100-500 muA) in the HFS group (n = 7) when seizures were visually detected, while no stimulation was delivered in the sham control group (n = 8). Various severities of seizures were obtained (Stage I-V) and all rats of both groups reached Stage V (Racine's scale) on Day 1. The HFS group had less focal seizures and a longer inter-focal seizure interval on Day 1. Interictal spike rate was also lower in the HFS group and decreased with injection days. Significant day effects were found for the latency, number of focal seizures, and duration of focal seizures and generalized seizures while differences between groups were no longer present. Responsive HFS did not disrupt ongoing seizures. However, focal seizures and interictal spikes were suppressed by HFS. Such anticonvulsant effects of acute subicular stimulation indicate that the subiculum is involved in seizure generation.

vagus nerve stimulation","Antiepileptic drugs allow controlling seizures in 70% of patients. For the others, a presurgical workup should be undertaken, especially if a focal seizure origin is suspected; how ever, only a fraction of pharmacoresistant patients will be offered resective (curative) surgery. In the last 15 years, several palliative therapies using extraor intracranial electrical stimulations have been developed. This article presents the vagal nerve stimulation, the deep brain stimulation (targeting the mesiotemporal region or the thalamus), and the cortical stimulation <<on demand>>. All show an overall longterm responder rate between 3050%, but less than 5% of patients becoming seizure free. It is to hope that a better understanding of epileptogenic mechanisms and of the implicated neuronal networks will lead to an improvement of these proportions.",Click here for full text options,"cortical stimulation [other term]

vagus nerve stimulation","Therapeutic devices provide new options for treating drug-resistant epilepsy. These devices act by a variety of mechanisms to modulate neuronal activity. Only vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), which continues to develop new technology, is approved for use in the United States. Deep brain stimulation of anterior thalamus for partial epilepsy recently was approved in Europe and several other countries. Responsive neurostimulation, which delivers stimuli to 1 or 2 seizure foci in response to a detected seizure, recently completed a successful multicenter trial. Several other trials of brain stimulation are in planning or underway. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) may provide a noninvasive method to stimulate cortex. Controlled studies of TMS are split on efficacy, which may depend on whether a seizure focus is near a possible region for stimulation. Seizure detection devices in the form of shake detectors via portable accelerometers can provide notification of an ongoing tonic-clonic seizure, or peace of mind in the absence of notification. Prediction of seizures from various aspects of electroencephalography (EEG) is in early stages. Prediction appears to be possible in a subpopulation of people with refractory seizures, and a clinical trial of an implantable prediction device is underway. Cooling of neocortex or hippocampus reversibly can attenuate epileptiform EEG activity and seizures, but engineering problems remain in its implementation. Optogenetics is a new technique that can control excitability of specific populations of neurons with light. Inhibition of epileptiform activity has been demonstrated in hippocampal slices, but use in humans will require more work. In general, devices provide useful palliation for otherwise uncontrollable seizures, but with a different risk profile than with most drugs. Optimizing the place of devices in therapy for epilepsy will require further development and clinical experience.

The amygdala is one of the main parts of the limbic system susceptible to insults that lead to neuroinflammation and epilepsy. This study evaluates the effect of chronic inflammation of the rat amygdala induced by lipopoly saccharide (LPS) on kindling epileptogenesis. Method(s): LPS (5mug/rat) was infused once daily into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of adult rats. Daily electrical stimulation (150-300 muA, 100 Hz, monophasic square wave stimulus of 1 msec per wave, 2 secduration) was delivered into BLA 30 min after LPS injections until the animals became fully kindled. Result(s): LPS had no significant effect on the development of focal and generalized seizures. Conclusion(s): The type of neural system exposed to LPS and its specific electrophysiological properties seems to ascertain the final excitatory or inhibitory outcome.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The BG are probably not involved in elaborating clinical seizures, as they do not produce specific epileptiform activity and there is no evident change in the electrical activity in the BG immediately after seizure onset. The data we obtained by direct ictal recording in the BG [1,2], as well as a large body of experimental and clinical evidence reported by other groups, suggest an inhibitory role of the BG during temporal lobe seizures. The BG may have a remote influence on cortical oscillatory processes related to control of epileptic seizures via their feedback pathways to the cortex. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

vagus nerve stimulation","Epilepsies are among the most common neurologic disorders. Treatment is mainly symptomatic with antiepileptic drugs (AED) which are chosen depending on the epilepsy syndrome, side effects and patient profile. The aim of treatment is seizure freedom. Initially, a first line drug should be given in monotherapy in a sufficiently high dose. If combinations of two or more antiepileptic drugs are administered, unnecessary high doses should be reduced and ineffective drugs discontinued. Many AEDs are not (sufficiently) efficacious in idiopathic generalized epilepsies, first line drugs are valproate, ethosuximide and lamotrigine. Focal epilepsies can be treated with any AED, but because of their tolerability and low interaction profile lamotrigine and levetiracetam are often preferred. Nonpharmacological treatment options include epilepsy surgery, by which the seizure-generating tissue is resected, and brain stimulation (vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation). © Schattauer 2012.",Click here for full text options,,,Epilepsie: Wichtige therapieempfehlungen fur praxis und klinik.,

Up to 70% of the depressed patients suffered from residual symptoms despite adequate treatments and 20% or more may show limited response even with the most aggressive therapies. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is highly and rapidly effective for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), however, its use for less severe forms was somewhat limited by a restricted control of current spreads to medial temporal lobe memory structures, resulting often in cognitive (mainly amnestic) side effects. In contrast, the magnetic seizure therapy (MST) as new convulsive brain stimulation treatment method uses high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation for the local seizure induction and it is therefore not associated with the untoward cognitive side effects. Previous studies suggested that MST-induced seizures differed from seizures induced by ECT [1]. The current study was designed to examine and compare the seizure characteristics in MST and ECT in one and the same person. Method(s): To assess whether different characteristics of seizures induced by the both methods (MST and ECT) were responsible for the difference in neuropsychological side-effect profile, we studied seven TRD patients undergoing both MST and ECT in an open-label, within subject, controlled crossover study. The seven patients fulfilled non-responder criteria of depression symptoms after a full course of MST (10-12 treatments). The seizures were elicited under general anaesthesia. Comparison parameters included seizure-related ictal characteristics such as motor activity, electromyogram (EMG), and electroencephalogram (EEG) and additionally postictal recovery and reorientation times. Level of statistical significance was set at 5%. Paired t-tests were used to assess the mean values. The assessments and analyses of the outcome variables were done after each treatment. To assess the validity of the outcome measures, Cohen's d effect size was calculated. Effect sizes were defined as small d = 0.2; medium, d = 0.5 and large, d = 0.8. Result(s): No differences of the seizures characteristics concerning the duration of motor activity, EMG and EEG were demonstrated, thus implicating similar electrophysiological processes in seizure induction with MST and ECT. In line with previous studies, we observed shorter postictal recovery and reorientation times after MST compared to ECT [2], indicatively of a lower cognitive side-effect burden in focally induced convulsive therapies. Time of recovery (s) after MST (ECT) was measured at 84+/-61.49 (187.8+/-73.03) and time of full reorientation (s) 124.83+/-71.83 (463.2+/-291.28) (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): In contrast to previous studies, comparable seizure expression in ECT and MST were demonstrated, especially in ictal activity and postictal suppression in EEG. Ictal characteristics of seizures suggested being very similar pointing to the fact that the better side effect profile of MST might indeed be explained by the more focal seizure induction.",Click here for full text options,,,,

brain depth stimulation","Introduction: Deep brain Stimulation (DBS) is a new therapeutic modality for the treatment of Epilepsy. It is based on the assumption that the interference with the Anterior Nucleus of Thalamus (ANT), a key structure of the limbic system, can modify the neuronal circuitry mechanisms involved in the limbic epilepsy and led to a clinical relieve of this kind of seizures. The first robust study with this purpose was the Medtronic multicenter SANTE study hold on 110 patients with refractory partial seizures. It showed a reduction in the number of seizures of 41% and 58% respectively after 1 and 3 years, despite only 14% patients got seizure free. The present study was aimed to evaluate the clinical outcome of this procedure in our first treated patients. Method(s): Four adult (2 male, 2 female) epileptic patients were bilaterally implanted with DBS electrodes (model 3387, Medtronic branched to an Activa PC pulse generator) in the ANT between January and November 2011. The ages ranged from 26 to 38 years (mean: 33y). All patients had temporal lobe epilepsy refractory to long term anti-epileptic medication; two had already been operated, one with a vagal nerve stimulation implant, one other with selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy, both without satisfactory clinical results. All were submitted to our epilepsy surgery protocol. The DBS parameters were: pulse width - 90 mus, frequency - 145 pulses/min, amplitude - 5V, 1 min ON, 5 min OFF. The post-operative follow-up time was 6 to 12 months (mean:m.). Result(s): All patients were operated under general anesthesia. In 2 patients the electrode approach trajectories were extraventricular owing to the ventricular complex venous arrangement; in 1 the trajectories were transventricular and in 1 were transventricular on the right side and extraventricular on the left. No operative morbidity was registered. In 2 patients there was a reduction of the number of seizures and in all patients there was an improvement of the intensity and duration of the seizures. Two patients have no more drop attacks and one no more secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. All patients felt better concerning epilepsy and quality of life. Conclusion(s): Although a few patients were treated and a short post-implant follow-up time passed, our initial experience with the ANT for Epilepsy shows some positive results essentially on the improvement of seizures severity and quality of life, without significant morbidity.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): We have reviewed the medical records of 17 children affected by drug resistant focal epilepsy associated to HH, referred between January 1990 and December 2011 to the Neurology Division of the Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital in Rome, and ""Carlo Besta"" Neurological Institute in Milan. All clinical notes were reviewed in order to evaluate the age at onset, the seizure type at onset and during the follow-up, treatment and epilepsy outcome. HH were defined according to the classification proposed by Delalande et al (Delalande et al., 2003). In 4 out of 17 studied patients an intraoperative endoscopic intralesional recording was performed. In 3 cases intraoperative stereo-EEG was carried out using foramen ovale electrodes (Dixi Medical ACS- 798S, 5 contacts), and DBS leads in 1 case (Medtronic 3389, 4 contacts). Scalp-EEG was performed in all patients (referential montage, lacking frontal and central leads for surgical reasons). Result(s): In 10 out of 17 cases a surgical approach was performed: 4 of them underwent a one stage stereo-endoscopic disconnection, 3 cases a double stage stereo-endoscopic disconnection, and 1 case required a multistage stage stereo-endoscopic disconnection. One patient performed a bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) protocol, 1 a surgical resection, 1 radiotherapy, and 1 radiosurgery. Following Delalande classification HH were mostly of type 2 (8 out of 17), followed by type 3 (6 out of 17) and lastly type 4 (3 out of 17). No cases were classified as type 1. Data on intraoperative stereo-EEGAll patients (4 cases) presented gelastic seizures, associated to focal with secondarily generalization. Seizures frequency ranged from multiple per day to multiple per week. Seizure duration was between few seconds to 60 seconds. Following Delalande classification 2 patients had type 2 HH and other two had type 4 HH. Interictal scalp EEG showed epileptiform abnormalities in all patients, in 2 cases they were evident on temporal region, in one over bilateral parieto occipital, and in one over central and parietal regions. In all patients intraoperative scalp-EEG showed synchronous interictal epileptic discharges which were recorded from the same side of the lesion. From the depth electrode high amplitude fast activity in sequences of variable duration was recorded. In all cases the predominant side of the EEG abnormalities was ipsilateral to the activity recorded within the hamartoma. Conclusion(s): We detected the electrical activity of the lesion, and compared it with the scalp-EEG activity recorded in the same time. Our data confirm the epileptogenicity of HH. Clinical and neurophysiological findings in all described cases suggest that the cortical activation is secondary to the epileptogenic activity of HH. Intraoperative electrographic recording may be considered as part of a strategy of trans-endoscopic surgery for HHs.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Multiple brain MRI examinations were normal and extensive metabolic, haematological and serological tests were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (protein, glucose, microbiology, oligoclonal bands) was normal except patient A had 7 white cells/ml. Both received broad spectrum antimicrobials. Method(s): In patient A generalized tonic-clonic seizures led to ventilation and ultimately treatment with six anti-epileptic drugs (AED). The EEG initially showed a suppression burst pattern; following reduction of sedation, status epilepticus (SE) with a right temporal focus, plus generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs). It was some three months before control was achieved but recovery was good with mild amnesia only. Result(s): Patient B had focal seizures with secondary generalization and then SE. The EEG revealed a right anterior focus, generalized seizures and GPEDs.

pediatric hospital","Introduction. Hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are well-recognised congenital malformations of the brain and represent a cause of medically intractable focal epilepsy. Interictal and ictal scalp EEG is usually poorly informative in most cases. Aim. To report the results of acute intralesional recording of the interictal activity arising inside the HH in four cases and to compare this with concurrent scalp EEG. Methods.We have reviewed the medical records of 17 children affected by drug-resistant focal epilepsy associated with HH, referred between January 1990 and December 2011 to the Neurology Division of the Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital in Rome and ""Carlo Besta"" Neurological Institute in Milan. All clinical notes were reviewed in order to evaluate the age at onset, the seizure type at onset and during the follow-up, treatment, and epilepsy outcome. HHs were defined according to the classification proposed by Delalande et al. (Delalande et al., 2003). In 4 of 17 patients studied, an intraoperative endoscopic intralesional recording was performed. In 3 cases, intraoperative stereo-EEG was carried out using foramen ovale electrodes (Dixi Medical ACS-798S, 5 contacts) and DBS leads in 1 case (Medtronic 3389, 4 contacts). Scalp-EEGwas performed in all patients (referential montage, lacking frontal and central leads for surgical reasons). Results. In 10 of 17 cases, a surgical approach was performed: 4 of these underwent a one-stage stereoendoscopic disconnection, three cases a double-stage stereo-endoscopic disconnection, and 1 case required a multistage stereo-endoscopic disconnection. A bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) protocol was performed for 1 patient, 1 a surgical resection, 1 radiotherapy, and 1 radiosurgery. Following the Delalande classification, HH were mostly of type 2 (8 of 17), followed by type 3 (6 of 17) and lastly type 4 (3 of 17). No cases were classified as type 1. All patients (4 cases) presented gelastic seizures, associated with focal and secondary generalisation. Seizure frequency ranged from multiple per day to multiple per week. Seizure duration was between a few seconds to 60 seconds. Following Delalande classification, 2 patients had type 2 HH and another 2 had type 4 HH. Interictal scalp EEG showed epileptiform abnormalities in all patients; in 2 cases these were evident on the temporal region, in 1 over the bilateral parieto-occipital region, and in 1 over the central and parietal regions. In all patients, intraoperative scalp EEG showed synchronous interictal epileptic discharges which were recorded from the same side of the lesion. From the depth electrode, high-amplitude fast activity in sequences of variable duration was recorded. In all cases, the predominant side of the EEG abnormalities was ipsilateral to the activity recorded within the hamartoma. Discussion. We detected the electrical activity of the lesion and compared it with the scalp EEG activity recorded at the same time. Our data confirm the epileptogenicity of HH. Clinical and neurophysiological findings in all described cases suggest that the cortical activation is secondary to the epileptogenic activity of HH. Intraoperative electrographic recording may be considered as part of a strategy of transendoscopic surgery for HHs.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Recently, in a patient suffering from partial epilepsy in relationship to a focal cortical dysplasia (CD) in the premotor cortex (PMC), we observed that DBS in the centromedian (CM) thalamic nucleus dramatically reduced the sustained paroxystic activity in the PMC [2]. Visual analysis of depth-EEG recordings showed that some stimulation parameters (frequency and amplitude) could induce a remarkable modulation of the dysplastic pattern whereas others did not affect the signals recorded in the PMC. This unique observation obtained in a human subject led us to quantitatively investigate the mechanisms involved in the modulation of epileptic activity by indirect thalamic stimulation. Our objective is twofold: i) to uncover the time-frequency content of depth-EEG signals recorded in the PMC before, during and after stimulation of the CM, and ii) to explain, from a neurophysiological viewpoint, this effects and their dependence on stimulation parameters, in particular the frequency. Method(s): To quantify the time-frequency content of depth-EEG signals we used the Matching Pursuit method which operates signal decomposition into 'atoms' (Gabor, Fourier, and Dirac). A feature vector representing the signal energy distribution in predefined frequency bands (delta to gamma) was then built using this decomposition. Feature vectors were computed on segments of depth-EEG activity. They were used to assess the similarities/differences among these segments, as recorded before, during and after stimulation and also for various stimulation parameters. Besides, we introduced a physiologically-relevant computational model of the cortex in order to identify some key parameter configurations (related to excitation, feedback and feedforward inhibition in the PMC) allowing for accurate reproduction of observed effects, in particular the suppression of the paroxystic activity in the CD. Result(s): Signal processing showed a reduction of at least 68% in the dysplastic slow pattern (2-4 Hz) for a stimulation at 2, 70, 100 and 150Hz but less than 8% at 50Hz. Moreover, an increase of energy in the beta-1 band (12-18Hz) was exclusively observed for high frequency stimulations. Computational modeling allowed us to generate hypotheses, at a neuronal population level, on the origin of these stimulation-dependant cortical modulations, as reflected by depth-EEG signals. Main findings include i) the specific behaviour of the principal cells in the CM nucleus in response to stimulation frequency and ii) the subtle role of collateral excitation and feedforward inhibition in the PMC in response to CM input. Conclusion(s): Stimulation of the CM can modulate electrical activity in a CD located in the PMC.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Parkinson disease","Rationale: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an approved therapy for Parkinson disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. According to the Medtronic database, more than 80,000 patients have had implantation of DBS electrodes thus far. In addition to approved uses, DBS is being investigated for other movement disorders, pain conditions, psychiatric conditions, and epilepsy. It is anticipated, therefore, that use of DBS will increase in the future. Seizure is one complication associated with place ment of DBS electrodes. The incidence of seizures in the immediate post-operative period has ranged from 0 to 10% in different case series. A recent meta-analysis estimated a risk of 2.4%, but noted flaws in available data, including inconsistent and duplicate reporting (Coley et al, 2009, Brit J Neurosurg 23:179-83). The subsequent clinical course of patients who suffer perioperative seizures is not known, nor is the risk of developing seizures or epilepsy in the late-postoperative period. Method(s): We present a retrospective case series based on chart review of all patients who underwent DBS surgery for any indication at Mayo Clinic Arizona between 2002 and 2010. Data gathered included: age, sex, indication for surgery, DBS target, number of surgeries, pre-operative seizure risk factors, post-operative imaging abnormalities, post-operative time to seizure, semiology of seizure, EEG findings, treatment initiated and duration of treatment. Results are presented as percentages of total (n=116) or percentage of those with seizure (n=5). Due to the small incidence of post-operative seizures, the data were not appropriate for parametric statistical analysis, but results are presented as percentages of total and of patients with seizures. Result(s): Of 116 patients who underwent DBS surgery, 5 had documented seizures at some point after surgery, representing 4.3% of patients, and 2.3% of surgeries performed. No subjects had a preexisting seizure disorder. 1/5 had a seizure only four years after surgery, which was likely related to a later stroke rather than the DBS surgery. The other seizures occurred at 7 hours, 17 hours, 24 hours, and 48 days after surgery. 2/3 who seized within 24 hours after surgery had hemorrhage on their post-op imaging (66%), compared to 16% of total patients. Those 2 also had focal seizures with secondary generalization, while the remaining 3 had apparently generalized seizures without lateralizing findings on EEG. No patients developed epilepsy or required treatment beyond one year. While 14% of patients undergoing DBS had risk factors for seizures prior to surgery, none who did seize had any prior risk factors. Conclusion(s): Our data support an incidence of post-operative seizures with DBS implantation at 2.3% of surgeries, consistent with prior studies. The number of pre-operative seizure risk factors was unrelated to occurrence of post-operative seizures, but bleeding complications did increase risk. This information is especially useful given investigations into using DBS as a treatment for epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Acute deep brain macrostimulation intraoperative findings were sparsely published in the literature. We report on our intraoperative macrostimulation findings during thalamic and hippocampal DBS implantation. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighteen patients were studied. All patients underwent routine pre-operative evaluation that included clinical history, neurological examination, interictal and ictal EEG, high resolution 1.5T MRI and neuropsychological testing. Six patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were submitted to hippocampal DBS (Hip-DBS); 6 patients with focal epilepsy were submitted to anterior thalamic nucleus DBS (AN-DBS) and 6 patients with generalized epilepsy were submitted to centro-median thalamic nucleus DBS (CM-DBS). Age ranged from 9 to 40 years (11 males). All patients were submitted to bilateral quadripolar DBS electrode implantation in a single procedure, under general anesthesia, and intraoperative scalp EEG monitoring. Final electrode's position was checked postoperatively using volumetric CT scanning. Bipolar stimulation using the more proximal and distal electrodes was performed. Final standard stimulation parameters were 6 Hz, 4 V, 300usec (low frequency range: LF) or 130 Hz, 4 V, 300usec (high frequency range: HF). Result(s): Bilateral recruiting response (RR) was obtained after unilateral stimulation in all patients submitted to AN and CM-DBS using LF stimulation. RR was widespread but prevailed over the fronto-temporal region bilaterally, and over the stimulated hemisphere. HF stimulation led to background slowing and a DC shift. The mean voltage for the appearance of RR was 4 V (CM) and 3 V (AN). CM and AN-DBS did not alter inter-ictal spiking frequency or morphology. RR obtained after LF Hip-DBS was restricted to the stimulated temporal lobe and no contralateral activation was noted. HF stimulation yielded no visually recognizable EEG modification. Mean intensity for initial appearance of RR was 3 V. In 5 of the 6 patients submitted to Hip-DBS, an increase in inter-ictal spiking was noted unilaterally immediately after electrode insertion. Intraoperative LF stimulation did not modify temporal lobe spiking; on the other hand, HF was effective in abolishing inter-ictal spiking in 4 of the 6 patients studied. There was no immediate morbidity or mortality in this series. Discussion(s): Macrostimulation might be used to confirm that the hardware was working properly. There was no typical RR derived from each studied thalamic nuclei after LF stimulation. On the other hand, absence of such RRs was highly suggestive of hardware malfunction or inadequate targeting. Thalamic-DBS (Th-DBS) RR was always bilateral after unilateral stimulation, although they somehow prevailed over the stimulated hemisphere. Conclusion(s): Contrary to Th-DBS, Hip-DBS gave rise to localized RR over the ipsolateral temporal neocortex, and absence of this response might very likely be related to inadequate targeting or hardware failure. Increased spiking was seen over temporal neocortex during hippocampal electrode insertion; this might point to the more epileptogenic hippocampal region in each individual patient. We did not notice any intraoperative response difference among patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with or without MTS. The relationship between these intraoperative findings and seizure outcome is not yet clear and should be further evaluated.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Landau Kleffner syndrome","Objective: To determine characteristics, treatment and outcome of children with electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES). Background ESES is a rare EEG finding associated with Landau Kleffner syndrome (LKS) and Continuous Spike Wave in Sleep syndrome (CSWS). These syndromes are potentially treatable causes of developmental regression. Design/Methods: All patients with ESES seen at Mayo Clinic 2007-2011 were retrospectively identified. All patients underwent detailed evaluation, neurological examination, and prolonged EEG monitoring during evaluation and follow up. Medical records, EEGs, and neuroimaging were reviewed to determine clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome. Result(s): 30 patients were identified. Average age at onset of regression was 5.4 years (range 13 months to 11 years). 6/30 patients met criteria for LKS. 24/30 patients met criteria for CSWS. Etiologies included unknown cause (14/30), symptomatic (16/30). Specific etiologies included thalamic injury (3), hydrocephalus (4), cortical dysplasia (3). EEG abnormalities in LKS were maximally present over the frontotemporal head regions; in CSWS, EEG abnormalities were more diffuse. Presenting symptoms included: regression of language, regression of motor skills, frontal lobe syndrome (inattention, impulsivity, difficulty with planning and sequencing activities), behavioral difficulties, autistic features, and decreased level of consciousness. 26/30 patients underwent treatment with followup at Mayo Clinic. Successful therapies include diazepam, corticosteroids, IVIG, ethosuximide, zonisamide, focal parietal resection, temporal lobectomy, although relapses did occur. Unsuccessful treatments include valproic acid, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, sulthiame, felbamate, deep brain stimulation, mycophenolate mofetil. 24/26 patients responded to treatment. 6/24 patients relapsed. 17/26 are currently in remission. Follow up time was 1.7 patient years. Conclusion(s): ESES is a rare but treatable cause of childhood developmental regression. It is important to screen children with seizures and regression for ESES as this is a treatable conditon. Effective treatments may include diazepam, prednisone, IVIG, ethosuximide, zonisamide, focal epilepsy surgery. Relapse is common, but terminal remission is possible.",Click here for full text options,,,,

It is already prevalent in psychology, cognitive and basic neuroscience research and is being used increasingly as a tool for clinical decision-making in epilepsy. It has been used to determine language location and laterality in patients, sometimes eliminating the need for invasive tests. fMRI can been used pre-surgically to guide resection margins, preserving eloquent cortex. Other fMRI paradigms assessing memory, visual and somatosensory systems have limited clinical applications currently, but show great promise. Simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) and fMRI has also provided insights into the networks underlying seizure generation and is increasingly being used in epilepsy centres. In this review, we present some of the current clinical applications for fMRI in the pre-surgical assessment of epilepsy patients, and examine a number of new techniques that may soon become clinically relevant.",Click here for full text options,,,,

treatment outcome","Different pathologies such as tumors or focal dysplasias can be removed from eloquent areas without subsequent functional deficits. What has not yet been established is the removal of structural abnormalities in sensorimotor area associated with substantial neurological deficits performed in order to accomplish functional improvement. Neurosurgical resections in highly eloquent areas thus hold promise to open a new field-achievement of functional restitution even in cases with long-standing deficits. We present four exemplary cases where the removal of different structural abnormalities led to an impressive improvement of motor deficits. One patient had bilateral ischemic lesion resulting from perinatal hypoxia, one cavernoma, and two focal cortical dysplasias. All presented with motor or sensorimotor deficits and three had long-standing therapy refractory focal seizures. The extent of safe lesionectomy was determined using fMRI, fiber tracking, and PET studies and performed with intraoperative functional neuronavigation guidance and cortical stimulation. The achievement of the planned amount of resection was verified with an intraoperative MR examination. New persisting neurological deficits after surgery were not registered. One patient had temporary worsening of the right hand weakness that rapidly resolved. One patient was completely seizure free, and in two patients, the seizures' frequency, duration, and severity were significantly reduced. The preoperatively disturbed motor function improved in all four cases in the course of days or weeks. In summary, pathological processes affecting the sensorimotor area may cause focal seizures and/or compromise sensorimotor functions. Lesionectomy may accomplish not only the amelioration of focal seizures but also substantial functional improvement. © Springer-Verlag 2011.",Click here for full text options,lesionectomy [other term],,,

Epilepsy may be genetic or have a structural or metabolic cause (identified or unknown). The most common differential diagnoses are syncope and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Seizures may be generalized or focal, and take different forms. All patients developing seizures should have an ECG, and neuroimaging should be undertaken in all patients developing epilepsy in whom a focal cause is suspected, with the exception of genetic focal epilepsies. Antiepileptic medication should be tailored to the specific needs of the patient, with particular reference to the seizure type(s) and epilepsy syndrome. Other needs, such as the likelihood of pregnancy, and the presence of co-morbidities including learning disability and psychiatric disorders also need to be taken into account. Patients not responding to antiepileptic drugs may be candidates for surgery. The need for ongoing medication should be regularly reviewed in patients in long-term remission. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Click here for full text options,,,,

treatment outcome","There is a long-recognized association between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and chronic epilepsy, most notably refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The literature documents this association with case reports, patient series, and some larger controlled studies that reveal that almost a quarter of patients with TLE exhibit OCD features, which may go unrecognized. Obsession features with ordering, symmetry, exactness, handwashing, and religiosity occur more often in persons with right- or left-sided epileptic foci than in those with idiopathic generalized epilepsies or controls. Neurobiological and social factors suggest abnormalities of the frontal-thalamic-pallidal-striatal-anterior cingulate-frontal circuits stemming from the observation that certain diseases, damage, or surgery along these circuits may produce or, conversely, reduce OCD in TLE. This review explores the literature on case reports, case series, and larger retrospective controlled studies and looks at the associations of epilepsy with OCD. Contemporary speculation on the theoretical neurobiological underpinnings provides some basis on how and where to direct treatment. Invasive deep brain stimulation has triggered recent controversy on newer treatment modalities. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

At this time, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy is the only Food and Drug Administation-approved neurostimulation modality; it has been shown to be efficacious and just as well tolerated in children and adolescents as in adults. Notwithstanding the initial cost of the device and implantation, VNS therapy has been shown to be a cost-effective treatment, reducing direct medical costs and improving health-related quality of life measures. Deep brain stimulation of various brain regions, especially the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and responsive neurostimulation, also appear effective but are not yet approved for clinical use.

However, many focal abnormalities remain undetected in routine visual inspection. Here we use an automated, surface-based method for quantifying morphometric features related to epileptogenic cortical malformations to detect abnormal cortical thickness and blurred gray-white matter boundaries. Using MRI morphometry at 3T with surface-based spherical averaging techniques that precisely align anatomical structures between individual brains, we compared single patients with known lesions to a large normal control group to detect clusters of abnormal cortical thickness, gray-white matter contrast, local gyrification, sulcal depth, jacobian distance and curvature. To assess the effects of threshold and smoothing on detection sensitivity and specificity, we systematically varied these parameters with different thresholds and smoothing levels. To test the effectiveness of the technique to detect lesions of epileptogenic character, we compared the detected structural abnormalities to expert-tracings, intracranial EEG, pathology and surgical outcome in a homogeneous patient sample. With optimal parameters and by combining thickness and GWC, the surface-based detection method identified 92% of cortical lesions (sensitivity) with few false positives (96% specificity), successfully discriminating patients from controls 94% of the time. The detected structural abnormalities were related to the seizure onset zones, abnormal histology and positive outcome in all surgical patients. However, the method failed to adequately describe lesion extent in most cases. Automated surface-based MRI morphometry, if used with optimized parameters, may be a valuable additional clinical tool to improve the detection of subtle or previously occult malformations and therefore could improve identification of patients with intractable focal epilepsy who may benefit from surgery. © 2011 Thesen et al.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Epileptic seizures can cause impairment of consciousness, and the study of how this occurs has informed us about the neural mechanisms that underlie normal consciousness. Moreover, loss of consciousness during seizures increases injury risk and worsens health-related quality of life.

treatment response","Objectives: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial assessed the safety and effectiveness of responsive cortical stimulation as an adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures in adults with medically refractory epilepsy. Method(s): A total of 191 adults with medically intractable partial epilepsy were implanted with a responsive neurostimulator connected to depth or subdural leads placed at 1 or 2 predetermined seizure foci. The neurostimulator was programmed to detect abnormal electrocorticographic activity. One month after implantation, subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive stimulation in response to detections (treatment) or to receive no stimulation (sham). Efficacy and safety were assessed over a 12-week blinded period and a subsequent 84-week open-label period during which all subjects received responsive stimulation. Result(s): Seizures were significantly reduced in the treatment (-37.9%, n = 97) compared to the sham group (-17.3%, n = 94; p = 0.012) during the blinded period and there was no difference between the treatment and sham groups in adverse events. During the open-label period, the seizure reduction was sustained in the treatment group and seizures were significantly reduced in the sham group when stimulation began. There were significant improvements in overall quality of life (p < 0.02) and no deterioration in mood or neuropsychological function. Conclusion(s): Responsive cortical stimulation reduces the frequency of disabling partial seizures, is associated with improvements in quality of life, and is well-tolerated with no mood or cognitive effects. Responsive stimulation may provide another adjunctive treatment option for adults with medically intractable partial seizures. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that responsive cortical stimulation is effective in significantly reducing seizure frequency for 12 weeks in adults who have failed 2 or more antiepileptic medication trials,3or more seizures per month, and 1 or 2 seizure foci. © 2011 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

sensorimotor cortex","Purpose: CO2 has been long recognized for its anticonvulsant properties. We aimed to determine whether inhaling 5% CO2 can be used to suppress seizures in epilepsy patients. The effect of CO2 on cortical epileptic activity accompanying behavioral seizures was studied in rats and nonhuman primates, and based on these data, preliminary tests were carried out in humans. Method(s): In freely moving rats, cortical afterdischarges paralleled by myoclonic convulsions were evoked by sensorimotor cortex stimulation. Five percent CO2 was applied for 5 min, 3 min before stimulation. In macaque monkeys, hypercarbia was induced by hypoventilation while seizure activity was electrically or chemically evoked in the sensorimotor cortex. Seven patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy were examined with video-EEG (electroencephalography) and received 5% CO2 in medical carbogen shortly after electrographic seizure onset. Result(s): In rats, 5% CO2 strongly suppressed cortical afterdischarges, by approximately 75%, whereas responses to single-pulse stimulation were reduced by about 15% only. In macaques, increasing pCO2 from 37 to 44-45 mm Hg (corresponding to inhalation of 5% CO2 or less) suppressed stimulation-induced cortical afterdischarges by about 70% and single, bicuculline-induced epileptiform spikes by approximately 25%. In a pilot trial carried out in seven patients, a rapid termination of electrographic seizures was seen despite the fact that the application of 5% CO2 was started after seizure generalization. Conclusion(s): Five percent CO2 has a fast and potent anticonvulsant action. The present data suggest that medical carbogen with 5% CO2 can be used for acute treatment to suppress seizures in epilepsy patients. © 2010 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,Sigma Aldrich [United States]

Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has been a well established palliative therapy for almost 20 years, however, complete seizure control is rarely obtained. Its favourable effect on mood has been noted in several studies, and VNS was FDA-approved for the treatment of major depression in 2005. Intracerebral electrical stimulation is currently being evaluated as a potential treatment for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy in whom surgery cannot be offered. We summarise the results of various studies applying deep brain stimulation (DBS) to different brain structures, particularly to the mesial temporal lobe. From these studies, it appears that the efficiency of DBS to reduce epileptic seizures is demonstrated in a sufficiently large patient population but the exact determinants (physical parameters, syndromes) of its success (or its absence) remain unknown. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has been investigated as an antiepileptic treatment in patients with focal seizure onset by several groups, however, the clinical success is variable and in most studies rather low.",Click here for full text options,*repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [other term],,,

Seizure-prone states may be characterized by changes in tissue oxygenation (OXY), and changes in tissue OXY have been observed in response to spontaneous seizures and epileptiform discharges. If tissue OXY changes contribute to seizure generation, then interventions that alter tissue OXY may have therapeutic value. In this study, we characterized tissue OXY changes in response to a range of electrical stimulation that is used in epilepsy research and therapy in control and tetanus toxin (TX) treated rats. Method(s): Focal seizures were induced by injecting TX (50ng/0.5il) into the neocortex or dorsal hippocampus of adult male Sprague- Dawley rats (275-325g) anesthetized with isoflurane. Each rat was allowed to recover a minimum of two weeks. For tissue OXY experiments, control and TX rats were anesthetized with ketamine (80mg/kg) and xylazine (12mg/kg, IP) and placed in a stereotaxic. An oxygen-sensitive optical probe (Presens) was attached to a platinumiridium electrode and lowered to the same coordinates used for the TX injection. OXY measurements were acquired continuously at 4 samples/ sec from either the hippocampus or neocortex. High-frequency (HFS: 20, 60, 200Hz), and low-frequency (LFS: 1Hz) stimulations were tested. Symmetrical biphasic square wave pulses were used, and were 160isec/phase for HFS and 500msec/phase for LFS. Pulse amplitudes ranged from 0.1-0.6mA. Burst durations were 2sec for HFS and 10sec for LFS. Because voltage tended to increase with the duration of the LFS, additional voltage-controlled experiments were performed with LFS using long bursts (30-600sec) of low-voltage controlled (+/-1V) stimulation. Result(s): Tissue OXY changes were observed for all stimulation frequencies, and response amplitude tended to increase with current amplitude. The typical response, especially at high amplitudes, was a transient oxygenation decrease lasting several seconds, followed by a prolonged increase lasting for tens of seconds. In some cases, the OXY baseline changed after stimulation. For HFS, 20 and 200Hz evoked a small initial decrease, followed by a much larger OXY increase, while 60Hz stimulation evoked a large initial decrease followed by an even larger increase. The response to LFS was qualitatively different. The late OXY increase was much larger than that of the HFSs and often resulted in a persistent increase in the oxygenation baseline. Further experiments with LFS in the TX rat revealed a transient decrease in EEG spiking after LFS, and a mitigating effect on the OXY decreases associated with spontaneous seizures. Conclusion(s): The observation that changes in tissue OXY varied by stimulation frequency and intensity suggest that stimulation-induced changes in tissue OXY could contribute to the therapeutic effect of responsive stimulation. These observations also suggest that measurement of tissue OXY can be a useful tool for assessing neural responses to electrical stimulation.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Previous studies reported probability maps generated using either electrical brain stimulation (EBS) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, there are reports that find EBS inadequate for language mapping in children younger than 10 years of age (Schevon et al., Epilepsia, 2007) and fMRI an unsuitable replacement at present (Giussani et al., Neurosurgery, 2010). A more recently developed approach of mapping language cortex involves detection of gamma-augmentation that represents cortical activation driven by a task. In the present study, we have generated naming probability maps using event-related gammaaugmentation on electrocorticography (ECoG) and determined the interindividual variability in localization of cortices involved in auditory language functions. Method(s): We studied 10 patients with focal epilepsy who underwent extraoperative ECoG and subsequent resective epilepsy surgery. All patients underwent preoperative MRI and an auditory naming task for cortical mapping using EBS as well as ECoG. They completed up to 100 question-and-answer trials recorded and integrated with ECoG. Questions were designed to elicit 1 or 2 word answers; e.g. Q: 'What flies in the sky?' ECoG traces were temporally locked to responseonset and transformed into time-frequency matrices. To create an average probability map of naming function, all ECoG electrode positions in native space were transferred into MNI152 template space using landmark-constrained conformal cortical mapping (Muzik et al., Int J Biomed Imaging, 2007). Result(s): The question-and-answer task required up to 20 minutes of each patient's time. Our findings indicate gamma-augmentations sequentially involving bilateral posterior superior temporal gyri, posterior left middle and inferior frontal gyri, and bilateral inferior preand post-central gyri. Gamma-augmentations in the superior temporal gyri driven by auditory stimuli as well as those in the pre- and postcentral gyri driven by vocal responses were highly consistent across individuals in localization. However, gamma-augmentation during a delay period between auditory stimulus and vocal response had highly variable inter-individual localization and involved variable portions of the left frontal and temporal areas. Conclusion(s): Naming-related gamma-augmentations may identify cortex participating in naming activity in both hemispheres. This timeefficient technique may reveal how cerebral cortex participates in auditory-naming processing in patients with focal epilepsy. We have found that gamma-augmentations during the delay period are highly variable in cortical localization among patients. These preliminary data are consistent with our working hypothesis that ECoG data can be used to generate a probability map of naming in humans.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): We report our results in the first two patients suffering from farmacoresistant epilepsy who were not suitable candidates for resective surgery and underwent anterior thalamic nucleus-deep brain stimulation (ANT-DBS) for the treatment of their epilepsy. Result(s): Patient 1: A 25-year-old female with temporal focal epilepsy due to cardioembolic stroke, had a mean of 10 partial complex seizures/ day and one atonic seizure/day. Bilateral 3387 electrods were implanted in ANT by a transventricular approach. ANT-DBS was started after 1 month. After 9 months of follow-up, she had almost complete remission of complex partial seizures (1/month), and her atonic seizures were reduced to one per week, only after a 6-month period. Patient 2: a 53 years-old male presenting initially with eating seizures and predominantly nocturnal epilepsy, which after a severe head injury evolved to a multifocal epilepsy. The seizure followed a pattern of 2-3 cluster per month (3-4 seizures per cluster), including frequente drop attacks. In this patient, because of abnormal large thalamic veins, we performed an alternative procedure to the transventricular approach to NAT with 3389 electrods. In a 3 months-follow-up, the seizure cluster frequency was reduced to 1 per month and the patient is seizure-free from Feb 19, 2011. Conclusion(s): Despite our short sample and follow-up, there seems to exist a few evidence showing that ANT DBS is a promising therapy for severe refactory epilepsy patients, and the benefit may be seen after a relatively long period after the start of the stimulation.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Six patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were submitted to hippocampal DBS (Hip-DBS); six patients with focal epilepsy were submitted to anterior thalamic nucleus DBS (AN-DBS) and six patients with generalized epilepsy were submitted to centro-median thalamic nucleus DBS (CM-DBS). Age ranged from 9 to 40 years (11 males). All patients were submitted to bilateral quadripolar DBS electrode implantation in a single procedure and intraoperative scalp EEG monitoring. Final standard stimulation parameters were 6 or 130 Hz, 4 V, 300 mus. Result(s): Bilateral recruiting response (RR) was obtained after unilateral stimulation in all patients submitted to AN and CM-DBS using LF stimulation. RR was widespread but prevailed over the frontotemporal region bilaterally. HF stimulation led to background slowing and a DC shift. RR obtained after LF Hip-DBS was restricted to the stimulated temporal lobe. HF stimulation yielded no visually recognizable EEG modification. In five of the six patients submitted to Hip-DBS, an increase in interictal spiking was noted unilaterally immediately after electrode insertion. Hippocampal HF was effective in abolishing interictal spiking in four of the six patients studied. Conclusion(s): Thalamic-DBS (Th-DBS) RR was always bilateral after unilateral stimulation. Contrary to Th-DBS, Hip-DBS gave rise to localized RR over the ipsolateral temporal neocortex. Increased spiking was seen over temporal neocortex during hippocampal electrode insertion. The relationship between these intraoperative findings and seizure outcome is not yet clear and should be further evaluated.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The EEG demonstrated epileptiform activity in the left perisylvian and perirolandic regions, developing into continuous spikeand- slow wave during sleep after a few months, in spite of antiepileptic treatment with several different drugs. The seizures continued, and there was also a loss of function of the right arm, together with a slowing of speech development. A prompt response to prednisolone treatment was seen, with abolishment of seizures, normalisation of EEG and of motor function.When the prednisolone treatment was tapered off to a dose below 0.5 mg/kg per day, the seizures and EEG abnormalities relapsed and the girl's motor function deteriorated consistently. A non-invasive mapping of the cortical function along the left central sulcus was successfully performed when the girl was 3 years old, using navigated brain stimulation. The motor areas for the right hand and arm were localised. The cortical mapping of the motor areas and EEG source localisation were fused in a 3D MRI volume. The results will be demonstrated, and the management in terms of steroid treatment and possible epilepsy surgery will be discussed.",Click here for full text options,,,,

tumor volume","BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Navigated brain stimulation (NBS) is an emerging technology that can be used for preoperative mapping of the motor cortex. It combines conventional transcranial magnetic stimulation with neuronavigation and achieves high precision by taking into account all relevant physical factors. In contrast to functional imaging technologies, NBS does not rely on voluntary patient movements for cortical mapping. Thus, NBS can be used even on patients with severe motor impairment. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: This article presents the case of a hemiplegic elderly woman with a brain tumor in the motor cortex. Preoperative NBS surprisingly demonstrated intact corticospinal tracts in the hemiplegic patient. The results modified the surgical strategy. Direct cortical stimulation was performed intraoperatively. The direct cortical stimulation results were in agreement with the preoperative NBS findings, and the clinical success of the surgery exceeded expectations. CONCLUSION(S): NBS can be used for preoperative mapping in plegic patients. Even more important, this case report discusses why tumor resection surgery based on NBS may sometimes lead to substantially better clinical outcomes than surgery planned according to functional imaging technologies.

Its clinical significance is implicated by semantic dementia or pure word deafness. Neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular nature, however, precluded precise localization of the cortex responsible for speech perception. Electrical cortical stimulation could delineate such localization by producing transient, functional impairment. We investigated engagement of the left anterior temporal cortex in speech perception by means of direct electrical cortical stimulation. Subjects were two partial epilepsy patients, who underwent direct cortical stimulation as a part of invasive presurgical evaluations. Stimulus sites were coregistered to presurgical 3D-MRI, and then to MNI standard space for anatomical localization. Separate from the posterior temporal language area, electrical cortical stimulation revealed a well-restricted language area in the anterior part of the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (aSTS/STG) in both patients. Auditory sentence comprehension was impaired upon electrical stimulation of aSTS/STG. In one patient, additional investigation revealed that the functional impairment was restricted to auditory sentence comprehension with preserved visual sentence comprehension and perception of music and environmental sounds. Both patients reported that they could hear the voice but not understand the sentence well (e.g., heard as a series of meaningless utterance). The standard coordinates of this restricted area at left aSTS/STG well corresponded with the coordinates of speech perception reported in neuroimaging activation studies in healthy subjects. The present combined anatomo-functional case study, for the first time, demonstrated that aSTS/STG in the language dominant hemisphere actively engages in speech perception. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Results are heterogeneous; therefore, more evidence from animal studies is required. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the therapeutic effects of parameters of direct stimulation of the cortical focus in a Macaca fascicularis presenting focal motor epilepsy. METHOD(S): We developed a model of motor seizures after intracortical injection of penicillin G in the primary motor cortex of a Macaca fascicularis. We performed electric epidural cortical stimulation at low, medium, and high frequency using continuous or short-term stimulation. Short-term stimulation was triggered on seizure onset, either visually or automatically with a seizure detection algorithm connected to a programmable stimulator. RESULT(S): Automated detection could detect 100% of the seizures, but ensuing cortical electric stimulation failed to abort seizures. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates the inefficacy of the stimulation of the cortical focus to prevent seizures induced by local injection of penicillin G. Because this model may be too severe to allow comparison to human epilepsies, further work is required in other monkey models of focal epilepsy.

serotoninergic system","Increasing evidence links exposure to stress early in life to long-term alterations in brain function, which in turn have been linked to a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders in humans. Electrophysiological approaches to studying these causal pathways have been relatively underexploited. Effects of early life stress on neuronal electrophysiological properties offer a set of potential mechanisms for these susceptibilities, notably in the case of epilepsy. Thus, we review experimental evidence for altered cellular and circuit electrophysiology resulting from exposure to early life stress. Much of this work focuses on limbic long-term potentiation, but other studies address alterations in electrophysiological properties of ion channels, neurotransmitter systems, and the autonomic nervous system. We discuss mechanisms which may mediate these effects, including influences of early life stress on key components of brain synaptic transmission, particularly glutamate, GABA and 5-HT receptors, and influences on neuroplasticity (primarily neurogenesis and synaptic density) and on neuronal network activity. The existing literature, although small, provides strong evidence that early life stress induces enduring, often robust effects on a range of electrophysiological properties, suggesting further study of enduring effects of early life stress employing electrophysiological methods and concepts will be productive in illuminating disease pathophysiology. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Click here for full text options,limbic epilepsy / etiology [other term],,,mk 801

Against the background of possible new postoperative neurological deficits and of evolving new radio oncological techniques, the indication for surgery is limited only to a subgroup of patients. In this retrospective study we present the clinical results after operative treatment of metastases within the central and paracentral brain region, with an emphasis on the short-term and mid-term functional outcome. We report on 20 patients suffering from subcortical brain metastases within the primary sensorimotor area, with a median volume on MRI-scans of 8.18 cm3. Patients were admitted to our department with a progressive hemiparesis (n = 11), focal seizures (n = 6) or other unspecific symptoms (n = 3) like headache, nausea, and neuropsychological disturbances, respectively. After updated MRI- and fMRI-scanning, intensive electrophysiological testing including MEP-brain mapping and interdisciplinary tumour-board discussion of each case, those patients were evaluated for surgery. Early postoperative control was done by MRI within the first 48 h. Follow-up took place in our outpatient department, assessing clinical criteria two and 6 weeks postoperatively, followed by clinical control and MRI-scans every 3 months. In all patients, surgery was performed under general anaesthesia, cranial neuro navigation and intraoperative motor cortex stimulation. Surgery and the early postoperative course were uneventful in all cases. After a 6 months follow-up, two patients had died. The motor deficits improved in seven patients and remained unchanged in four cases. One patient suffered from a new persistent hemiparesis. A temporary paresis occurred in two cases. In five patients there was no motor deficit pre- and postoperatively. The Karnofsky Performance Status improved in ten patients 6 months after surgery. Quality of Life, measured by the FACT-Br score, improved in 12 patients and remained unchanged in one patient. With modern techniques like fMRI-guided cranial neuronavigation and intraoperative neuromonitoring including direct stimulation of the motor cortex, microsurgical resection of subcortical paracentral metastases is feasible with an acceptable risk of neurological deterioration. Even preexistent deficits can improve with positive influence on the quality of life for oncological patients, being disabled by the symptoms caused by the cerebral lesion. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale","Object. The optimal age and disease duration for consideration of deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery are not well characterized in patients with Parkinson disease. The aim of this study was to assess variation in motor response to surgery among subgroups stratified by age and disease duration. Methods. A total of 46 patients referred for DBS were recruited for the study. Preoperative dyskinesia and rigidity scores were recorded, and then patients received bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Preoperative motor scores were then compared with postoperative scores over 1 year. Results. At 1 year postoperatively, patients with <= 10 years' disease duration showed a significant (45%) reduction in rigidity and a significant (64%) reduction in dyskinesia. Patients with > 10 years disease also showed a significant (70%) reduction in dyskinesia at 1 year postoperatively, but failed to show significant improvement in rigidity (31% reduction). Patients < 70 years old showed a significant (58%) improvement in rigidity and a significant (53%) improvement in dyskinesia. Finally, patients >= 70 years old showed a significant (90%) improvement in dyskinesia, but failed to show any significant change in rigidity at 1 year postoperatively. Conclusions. The postoperative improvement in rigidity for younger patients with shorter disease duration may indicate that performing early surgery maximizes the benefit of DBS. However, older patients with primarily dyskinesia symptoms also appear to have significant clinical improvement, and DBS can offer relief from this common consequence of long-term levodopa use. ©1944-2011 by the American Association of Neurosurgeons.",Click here for full text options,*subthalamic nucleus brain depth stimulation [other term],,,

We aimed to compare the propagation of focal seizures with onset in different brain regions. Method(s): Seven zones were defined as medial frontal (MF), dorsolateral frontal (DLF), orbitofrontal (OF), medial temporal (MF), lateral temporal (LT), parietal (P) and occipital (O). Routes and times of ipsilateral (IPT) and contralateral (CPT) propagation as well as ictal frequency in onset zone and propagation zone were compared. Result(s): Forty patients had 112 seizures. (Mean and median number of seizures per zone was 16 and 15). Preferred routes of propagation, based on ictal onset, were: MF to contralateral MF; DLF to ispilateral temporal lobe; OF to contralateral OF and ispilateral temporal lobe; MT to contralateral MT; LT to ispilateral MT and OF and contralateral LT and MT; P to ispilateral temporal lobe, DLF and O; O to ipsilateral MT. IPT and CPT varied markedly between zones. Ictal onset frequency was faster than propagated frequency. Conclusion(s): Seizure propagation varies according to onset zone possibly following major pathways. This needs confirmation. The findings could aid in the interpretation of symptoms and EEG and may result useful for future treatment using brain stimulation or disconnective surgery. The limitations are clearly stated. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Although many genetic contributions to seizure susceptibility have been identified, these involve disparate biological processes, many of which are not neural specific. The large number and heterogeneous nature of the genes involved makes it difficult to understand the complex factors underlying the etiology of seizure disorders. Examining the effect known genetic mutations have on seizure susceptibility is one approach that may prove fruitful. This approach may be helpful in both understanding how different physiological processes affect seizure susceptibility and identifying novel therapeutic treatments. We review here factors contributing to seizure susceptibility in Drosophila, a genetically tractable system that provides a model for human seizure disorders. Seizure-like neuronal activities and behaviors in the fruit fly are described, as well as a set of mutations that exhibit features resembling some human epilepsies and render the fly sensitive to seizures. Especially interesting are descriptions of a novel class of mutations that are second-site mutations that act as seizure suppressors. These mutations revert epilepsy phenotypes back to the wild-type range of seizure susceptibility. The genes responsible for seizure suppression are cloned with the goal of identifying targets for lead compounds that may be developed into new antiepileptic drugs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,"gap junction channel gene [other term]

Routine scalp electroencephalography (EEG) cannot always distinguish whether generalized epileptiform discharges are the result of primary bilateral synchrony or secondary bilateral synchrony (SBS) from a focal origin; this is an important distinction because the latter may be amenable to resection. Whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) has superior spatial resolution compared with traditional EEG, and can potentially elucidate seizure foci in challenging epilepsy cases in which patients are undergoing evaluation for surgery. Methods. Sixteen patients with medically intractable epilepsy in whom SBS was suspected were referred for magnetic source (MS) imaging. All patients had bilateral, synchronous, widespread, and most often generalized spike-wave discharges on scalp EEG studies, plus some other clinical (for example, seizure semiology) or MR imaging feature (for example, focal lesion) suggesting focal onset and hence possible surgical candidacy. The MS imaging modality is the combination of whole-head MEG and parametric reconstruction of corresponding electrical brain sources. An MEG and simultaneous EEG studies were recorded with a 275-channel whole-head system. Single-equivalent current dipoles were estimated from the MEG data, and dipole locations and orientations were super-imposed on patients' MR images. Results. The MS imaging studies revealed focal dipole clusters in 12 (75%) of the 16 patients, of which a single dipole cluster was identified in 7 patients (44%). Patient age, seizure type, duration of disease, video-EEG telemetry, and MR imaging results were analyzed to determine factors predictive of having clusters revealed on MS imaging. Of these factors, only focal MR imaging anatomical abnormalities were associated with dipole clusters (chi-square test, p = 0.03). Selective resections (including the dipole cluster) in 7 (87%) of 8 patients resulted in seizure-free or rare seizure outcomes (Engel Classes I and II). Conclusions. Magnetic source imaging may provide noninvasive anatomical and neurophysiological confirmation of localization in patients in whom there is a suspicion of SBS (based on clinical or MR imaging data), especially in those with an anatomical lesion. Identification of a focal seizure origin has significant implications for both resective and nonresective treatment of intractable epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Clinicians should hence lower their threshold to sample the insula with intracerebral electrodes. Lack of recognition of insular seizures may explain part of epilepsy surgery failures.

The current focus of his research is the use of large-scale system electrophysiology, brain stimulation, and data mining to identify and track electrophysiological biomarkers of epileptic brain and seizure generation. Electrophysiology is an important clinical and research tool for investigation of human brain. It is now possible to probe neural activity across a wide range of spatiotemporal scales; from extracellular action potentials of single neurons, local field potentials of neuronal assemblies, to macroscale clinical EEG. To investigate the spatiotemporal scales characterizing the genesis of focal seizures in humans, our group is performing wide bandwidth, continuous, long-term recordings in patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Here we report evidence that human epileptic brain is organized on spatial scales not probed by clinical EEG. In epileptic brain seizure-like events, called microseizures, were isolated to single microelectrodes, and not seen on macroelectrodes. Microseizures exhibit a wide range of spectral dynamics and occur asynchronously in non-contiguous regions of brain. Microseizures were increased in brain regions generating seizures and rare in brain regions not generating seizures, and were absent in control brain from patients without a history of seizures. Based on these findings we propose that epileptic brain is composed of pathological microcircuits generating microseizures that may be an early electrographic signature of ictogenesis.",Click here for full text options,,,,

frontal lobe epilepsy","Background: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is being increasingly used as a non-invasive brain stimulation technique for the therapeutic management of partial epilepsies. A number of open label and controlled studies provided evidence for a modest but statistically significant reduction in the frequency of seizures and interictal discharges after the application of repetitive TMS stimuli. However, the acute effects of TMS on epileptiform discharges in partial epilepsy remains unexplored. Objective(s): To investigate whether TMS can terminate epileptiform discharges in patients with partial epilepsy. Method(s): Three subjects (median age, 32 years) with drug resistant frontal lobe epilepsies characterized by particularly frequent epileptiform discharges (EDs), were studied. Seizure etiology included perisylvian syndrome (1 case) and head trauma (2 cases). In all patients, the epileptogenic focus was located in the hemispheric convexity on the right and was easily accessible to transcranial stimulation. TMS was applied over the area of the electrographic focus with a figure of 8 coil while simultaneously recording EEG with a 60-channel TMS-compatible EEG system (eXimia, Nexstim Ltd, Finland). TMS stimuli (trains of 1-10 stimuli at 1-3 Hz and 100% MSO stimulus intensity) were delivered at variable treatment latencies after the onset of EDs (range 0.5-10 secs). The effectiveness of TMS in aborting EDs was investigated using survival analysis. Result(s): With TMS, epileptiform discharges stopped within 2 seconds in 48 out of 59 cases. Without TMS, EDs stopped within 2 seconds in only 6 out of 55 cases. TMS was an effective method to abort EDs and this was statistically established even when adjusting for the treatment latency (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test: p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that repetitive TMS can terminate epileptiform discharges in patients with superficial epileptogenic foci. These preliminary data add to the limited current evidence that TMS can be used for the acute treatment of seizures.",Click here for full text options,,,,

If recognized within 5 min, LPTR's seizures with bizarre remembered felonious (or ""merely"" social) misbehavior can be volitionally aborted. Methodology: 24 randomly Court-referred felons out of c. 1000 felonious cases were neuro-psychiatrically examined, including elicitation of memories and associations, and reports from neurology, general medicine, psychology, sociological data, scalp EEG, CT or MRI. Result(s): The course of all 24 patients implicated partial seizures. The aura-like state begins with autonomic arousal (e.g. strange epigastric sensations, vomiting, diarrhea, racing pulse, sweating, hot-cold sensation, vertigo, urinary incontinence or ejaculation). Within c. 5 min, de novo psychotic symptoms appear (formed or unformed hallucinations, usually visual, and/or delusions, frequently of grandeur). If during the ""aura"" the patient left (by chance or in one case volitionally) the scene of these ""warning signs"", no seizure-like bizarre behavior occurs. Thus, this 5-min grace period is of the essence for the astute diagnostician as well as for future therapeutic intervention: The LPTR patient'sawarenessof such prodromal indicators has to be heightened so that he or she can avoid at least future re-occurrences of the following symptomatology. This consists of the gradually beginning or continuing psychotic signs (""ictus"") now accompanied by bizarre motiveless, nonvolitional, unplanned, out-of-character acts without emotional involvement. The perplexed patients remember and voluntarily confess their acts with deep guilt feelings, often with serious suicidal attempts. There have been 18 ""murderers"", 4 ""fire setters"", one ""bank robber "" (a monk). During the ""post-ictal"" phase, there was ""stupid"" behavior and/or experienced time and space distortions. The proposed 'limbic psychotic trigger reaction' (Pontius) consists of 12 symptoms and signs, strictly determined by 16 inclusion and 13 exclusion criteria (e.g. there was no drug/alcohol abuse, long standing psychosis, habitual violence, strong emotions [unlike impulsivity]). The striking fact that such LPTR ""seizures"" could only be aborted after onset (no longer later on) of the first appearing autonomic experiences merely by a physical removal from the environment in which they occurred implicates an involvement of the experimentally established neurophysiological mechanism of seizure kindling (God- dard, McIntyre) which requires no brain damage. (Accordingly, only half of the LPTR patients had some inconsistent abnormality on objective brain tests and half had a known history of closed head injury). Kindling is evoked by intermittent exposure to merely subthreshold stimuli (electrical, chemical or experiential. Kindling in lower mammals evokes convulsions, in primates mostly non- convulsive behavioral seizures (Wada) with indications of visual hallucinations (e.g. grasping as if for food). In humans, rare inadvertent kindling has been reported. The implication of the seizure kindling is further supported by the fact that all 24 LPTR patients had been social loners who did not share or compare their mild to moderate stresses but ruminated about them in memory, analogous to experimental intermittent exposure to subthreshold stimuli (electrical, chemical or experiential. Then, as a last stimulus, these patients encounter a highly individualized stimulus (actual or symbolic, of any modality) that vividly revives the memory of their past hurts whereby seizure kindling is elicited. In social loners, also genetic factors and/or childhood experiences need to be explored in the future. (By analogy, recent experiments with infant monkeys support such a possibility: Judy Cameron found changes in the expression of the GUCY1A3 gene in the amygdala). Interestingly, the amygdala is the most susceptible to kindling. Conclusion(s): One empirically supported feat of potential seizure abortion during its initial symptoms of autonomic arousal can only be executed by humans while a least during a state of ""paleo-consciousness"" whereby memory is still retained: To be aware of such a possible seizure abortion is essential for diagnosticians as well as for therapeutic intervention ""post facto"" to avoid re-occurrence . Such a potentially abortable partial seizure has been, proposed as 'limbic psychotic trigger reaction' (LPTR), implicating a transient fronto-limbic dysbalance between a seizure-activated limbic system transiently overwhelming prefrontal system monitoring and control. LPTR is consistent with two sets of established experimental knowledge:(1) Seizure kindling of primates (J. Wada) evokes nonconvulsive behavioral seizures with strange behavior and indications of visual hallucinations. (2) Direct electrical brain stimulation in presurgery patients evokes mesotemperobasal seizures (HG Wieser) and stimulation by P. Gloor et al. of the amygdala elicited ""psychic phenomena"" analogous to merely experiential stimulation in LPTR.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Approximately 90% of the incident cases in adults have partial epilepsy. The initial response to medication is of prognostic importance. Patients with symptomatic neurologic disease, foreign-tissue lesion, or developmental delay are less likely to be rendered seizure free. The goal of treatment is to render the individual seizure free. Many patients with partial epilepsy will not attain a seizure remission with antiepileptic drug therapy. Epilepsy surgery is an effective and safe alternative form of therapy for selected patients with intractable partial epilepsy.

Group-studies applying rTMS in epilepsy patients aiming to decrease epileptic spike- or seizure-frequency have led to inconsistent results. Here we studied whether therapeutic trains of rTMS have detectable effects on individual spike pattern and/or frequency in patients suffering from focal epilepsy. Five patients with focal epilepsy underwent one session of rTMS online with EEG using a 6 Hz prime/1 Hz rTMS protocol (real and sham). The EEG was recorded continuously throughout the stimulation, and the epileptic spikes recorded immediately before (baseline) and after stimulation (sham and real) were subjected to further analysis. Number of spikes, spike-strength and spike-topography were examined. In two of the five patients, real TMS led to significant changes when compared to baseline and sham (decrease in spike-count in one patient, change in topography of the after-discharge in the other patient). Spike-count and topography remained unchanged the remaining patients. Overall, our results do not indicate a consistent effect of rTMS stimulation on interictal spike discharges, but speak in favor of a rather weak and individually variable immediate effect of rTMS on focal epileptic activity. The individuation of most effective stimulation patterns will be decisive for the future role of rTMS in epilepsies and needs to be determined in larger studies. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Click here for full text options,,,,

treatment indication",Dravet syndrome is a genetically determined severe epilepsy associated with cognitive decline and ataxia. The many types of seizures seen in these patients are typically pharmacoresistant. Here we describe two adults with Dravet syndrome who were treated with thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) and followed for 10 years. One patient with partial onset seizures received DBS at age 19 and showed a marked improvement in seizure control after DBS insertion and stimulation. The other patient with generalized onset seizures received DBS at age 34 and did not show any immediate benefit. No side effects or changes in cognition were observed in either of the patients. This is the first report of (short- and) long-term results in Dravet patients treated with thalamic DBS. We speculate that the results of DBS for epilepsy in patients with Dravet syndrome may be related to age at initiation of DBS treatment and seizure type. © 2009 International League Against Epilepsy.,Click here for full text options,*Dravet syndrome / *therapy [other term],,,

Objective(s): To assess the effectiveness of a programmable cranially implanted closed-loop neurostimulation system in the control of seizures originating from an area relatively inaccessible by open craniotomy. Method(s): A patient with drug-resistant partial epilepsy had previously undergone open resection of the left frontal opercular cortex and the underlying insular area. Although subdural-depth electrode ictal recordings had been nonlocalizing, depth electrode insular stimulation had produced the patient's habitual aura. Postoperatively, there was a sustained 50% reduction in seizure frequency. The residual seizures were identical to the preoperative seizures. Repeat depth electrode monitoring revealed that the ictal focus was immediately posterior to the previously resected insular area. A closed-loop cranial internal pulse generator system including left anterior insular and posterior orbitofrontal depth electrodes was implanted. Result(s): There was an additional 60% reduction of seizures. Conclusion(s): Preliminary observation indicates that responsive neurostimulation may be an effective alternative to higher-risk resective epilepsy surgery. Copyright © 2010 S.

reliability","Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides information about magnitude (diffusivity) and directionality (fractional anisotropy, FA) of water diffusion and allows visualization of major white matter tracts. The arcuate fasciculus (AF) connects anterior (Broca's) and posterior (Wernicke's) language areas. We hypothesized that essential language areas identified by direct cortical stimulation would colocalize with areas revealing subcortical connectivity via the AF. Method(s): Fourteen patients with pharmacoresistant left hemispheric epilepsy and left hemisphere language dominance underwent invasive evaluations for localization of epileptogenicity and functional mapping. DTI and TI-weighted volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were coregistered, and subdural grid electrodes identified on postimplantation computed tomography (CT) scans were also coregistered to the MRI scans. The AF was reconstructed from a region lateral to the corona radiata on the FA map. Colocalization, defined as <1 cm between the AF and the electrode positions delineating language cortex, was visually assessed with excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.98). Result(s): Atotal of 71 subdural grid contacts were overlying language cortex. Nineteen contacts in eight patients were over Broca's area, 16 of which (84.2%) colocalized with the AF. Fifty-two contacts in 10 patients were over Wernicke's area, with colocalization in 29 patients (55.8%). Colocalization was significantly greater in anterior regions than in posterior regions [chi2(1) = 4.850, p < 0.05]. Discussion(s): The AF, as visualized with DTI, colocalized well with anterior language areas, but less so with posterior language areas, inferring that the latter are more spatially dispersed. © 2009 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,*arcuate fasciculus [other term],,,

Method(s): Participants were adults with medically refractory partial seizures, including secondarily generalized seizures. Half received stimulation and half no stimulation during a 3-month blinded phase; then all received unblinded stimulation. Result(s): One hundred ten participants were randomized. Baseline monthly median seizure frequency was 19.5. In the last month of the blinded phase the stimulated group had a 29% greater reduction in seizures compared with the control group, as estimated by a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model (p = 0.002). Unadjusted median declines at the end of the blinded phase were 14.5% in the control group and 40.4% in the stimulated group. Complex partial and ""most severe"" seizures were significantly reduced by stimulation. By 2 years, there was a 56% median percent reduction in seizure frequency; 54% of patients had a seizure reduction of at least 50%, and 14 patients were seizure-free for at least 6 months. Five deaths occurred and none were from implantation or stimulation. No participant had symptomatic hemorrhage or brain infection. Two participants had acute, transient stimulation-associated seizures. Cognition and mood showed no group differences, but participants in the stimulated group were more likely to report depression or memory problems as adverse events. Discussion(s): Bilateral stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus reduces seizures. Benefit persisted for 2 years of study. Complication rates were modest. Deep brain stimulation of the anterior thalamus is useful for some people with medically refractory partial and secondarily generalized seizures. © 2010 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

With only one seizure, the focus should be more on defining the etiology than on treating the patient with antiepileptics, but with more prolonged or recurrent seizures, both should be pursued in parallel. Status epilepticus, if delayed or untreated, carries a grave prognosis and every ICU should have a protocol for rapid response to this neurological emergency.Continuous EEG monitoring should become mandatory, when treating status, because of the late dissociation between clinical convulsions and electrographic seizures and the inability to use the clinical examination as guide to the treatment. Focal and non-convulsive statuses have a different etiology and prognosis than generalized convulsive status epilepticus, and the treatment also differs. Several medications are available for treating seizures, but only few are available for parenteral, fast administration when treating status. The experience from using the newer antiepileptics in case of resistant status is therefore limited. Interactions between antiepileptics and common ICU medications may be significant and concurrent multi-organ failure may alter their metabolism. © Humana Press.",Click here for full text options,"cardiopulmonary depression / side effect [other term]

This study investigates whether VNS modulates cortical excitability by determining the threshold for provoking focal motor seizures by cortical electrical stimulation before and after VNS. Material and methods - Male Wistar rats (n = 8) were implanted with a cuff-electrode around the left vagus nerve and with stimulation electrodes placed bilaterally on the rat motor cortex. Motor seizure threshold (MST) was assessed for each rat before and immediately after 1 h of VNS with standard stimulation parameters, during two to three sessions on different days. Results - An overall significant increase of the MST was observed following 1 h of VNS compared to the baseline value (1420 muA and 1072 muA, respectively; P < 0.01). The effect was reproducible over time with an increase in MST in each experimental session. Conclusions - VNS significantly increases the MST in a cortical stimulation model for motor seizures. These data indicate that VNS is capable of modulating cortical excitability. © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The most explored targets for scheduled stimulation are the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the hippocampus. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus was studied in a large multicenter trial. There was a significant seizure reduction with the stimulator ""on"" versus ""off"" during several months after stimulator implantation. The hippocampus as stimulation target has not yet been studied in a large randomized trial. Responsive stimulation applies a stimulus whenever epileptiform activity occurs. It requires online detection of epileptiform activity. This concept is based on the observation that epileptiform activity during functional mapping can be aborted by brief pulses of cortical stimulation. Current technology is able to detect seizure activity intracranially on-line and delivers a high frequency stimulus if epileptiform activity is detected. A large randomized multicenter trial has been conducted testing this system for focal epilepsy. © 2010 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): Electrical currents were delivered through implanted subdural electrodes to six Mandarin-speaking patients before epilepsy surgery. The current intensities inducing any language disturbance during comprehension, repetition, and speech tasks were recorded, and individual cortical mapping was completed to guide subsequent resection, with the distance between mapped language sites and resected zones kept at a minimum of 0.5. cm. Language function was reassessed and followed up after surgery. Result(s): Language cortices were successfully identified in three patients, but demonstrated great variability in distribution. There seemed to be no difference in the intensity threshold that induced language interference. None of the six patients exhibited language deficits postsurgery. Conclusion(s): Electrical cortical stimulation with modified language tasks is valid for identification of cortices underlying Mandarin processing. The great variability in language cortex distribution enhances the necessity of individual language cortical mapping in epilepsy surgery. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,

During stimulation per chocs in the white matter of left dorsolateral area the patient presented a transitory impairment of executive functions, at on ad hoc cognitive assessment. During this stimulation we observed a spike-wave generalized EEG pattern, similar to that found in absence seizures. Patients with dorsolateral prefrontal circuit lesions and consequent executive impairment are reported in literature. Furthermore, some studies in absence epilepsy patients describe the same cognitive deficits found in the present case. There are also evidences of transitory cognitive impairment during EEG discharges. Our hypothesis about this patient is that we stimulated an important ""relais"" area, evoked a generalized EEG pattern associated with a global, transitory impairment of the cognitive functions modulated by Fontal Lobes.

We report the findings in 4 patients submitted to DBS. Method(s): Three patients (Patients 1-3) with generalized epilepsy previously submitted to callosal section and one patient (Patient 4) with bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia previously submitted to temporal lobe resection were studied. All patients had daily seizures. All patients were implanted bilaterally at the thalamus using a Kinetra device (Medtronics). Patients 1-3 were targeted at the centro-median nucleus and Patient 4 at the ventral-anterior nucleus. Present electrode settings are: Patient 1- 2V, 300 usec and 100 Hz (18 months of follow-up); Patient 2-0.8V, 300usec and 130 Hz (6 months of follow-up); Patient 3- 1V, 300 usec and 130 Hz (6 months of follow-up) and Patient 4- 2.25V, 300 usec and 100 Hz (18 months of follow-up). Result(s): Patient 1 has presently 1 seizure / month. Interestingly, he is much more alert and verbal output ismuch higher than before DBS;Patient 2 presently has 1 seizure / 10 days; Patient 3 has 1 seizure / week. Patient 4 remained seizure free for 2 months after DBS. Her present seizure frequency is 2 seizures / month. All patients presented increased attention with stimulation parameters lower then those required for seizure control. Conclusion(s): All patients benefit from the procedure. We are targeting the centro-median nucleus for patients with generalized epilepsy and the ventral-anterior nucleus in patients with focal epilepsy. Additional follow-up is needed to adequately assess the clinical outcome after DBS. Improvement in the attention deficit is precocious and seems unrelated to seizure control.",Click here for full text options,,,,

vagus nerve stimulation","Despite the advent of new pharmacological treatments and the high success rate of many surgical treatments for epilepsy, a substantial number of patients either do not become seizure-free or they experience major adverse events (or both). Neurostimulation-based treatments have gained considerable interest in the last decade. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an alternative treatment for patients with medically refractory epilepsy, who are unsuitable candidates for conventional epilepsy surgery, or who have had such surgery without optimal outcome. Although responder identification studies are lacking, long-term VNS studies show response rates between 40% and 50% and long-term seizure freedom in 5% to 10% of patients. Surgical complications and perioperative morbidity are low. Research into the mechanism of action of VNS has revealed a crucial role for the thalamus and cortical areas that are important in the epileptogenic process. Acute deep brain stimulation (DBS) in various thalamic nuclei and medial temporal lobe structures has recently been shown to be efficacious in small pilot studies. There is little evidence-based information on rational targets and stimulation parameters. Amygdalohippocampal DBS has yielded a significant decrease of seizure counts and interictal EEG abnormalities during long-term follow-up. Data from pilot studies suggest that chronic DBS for epilepsy may be a feasible, effective, and safe procedure.

We then outline key contributions from Europe and North America, and examine particularly the evolution of our understanding of temporal lobe seizures, which have now become the most common form of epilepsy amenable to surgical cure. © 2009 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

videorecording","The role of the insular lobe in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has often been suggested but never directly demonstrated. In this article, we review data from recent literature and from our own stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings in patients referred for temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. Our description of the clinical features of insular lobe seizures is based on data from video and SEEG ictal recordings and direct electric cortical stimulation in a population of 50 consecutive patients whose seizures, on the basis of scalp video EEG recordings, were suspected to originate from, or to rapidly propagate to, the perisylvian cortex. One hundred and forty-four intrainsular electrodes have been implanted in this series of patients. In six patients a stereotyped sequence of ictal symptoms could be identified on the basis of electroclinical correlations. The clinical presentation of insular lobe seizures is that of simple partial seizures occurring in full consciousness, beginning with a sensation of laryngeal constriction followed by paresthesiae that were often unpleasant and affected large cutaneous territories. These initial symptoms were eventually followed by dysarthric speech and/or elementary auditory hallucinations, and seizures often ended with focal dystonic postures. The insular origin of these symptoms was supported by the data from functional cortical mapping of the insula using direct cortical stimulations from a total of 472 intrainsular electrodes in 164 consecutive patients. We were able to reproduce several of the spontaneous ictal symptoms in the six patients with insular seizures. Moreover, from the whole set of insular stimulations that we performed it could be concluded that the insular cortex is involved in somatic, vegetative and visceral functions to which spontaneous ictal insular symptoms are related. The observation of the insular symptoms sequence at the onset of seizures in patients who are candidates for TLE surgery strongly suggests that the epileptic focus is located in the insular lobe. It entails the risk of unsuccessful temporal lobectomy and should lead to reconsider the indication of temporal lobectomy and to explore directly the ictal activity of both mesiotemporal and insular cortices before making any decision regarding epilepsy surgery. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We emphasise the clinical and electrophysiological features, and make comparisons with the primary psychoses. In this paper, we consider definitions and elementary hallucinatory phenomena. Regarding definition, there is a clearly divergent evolution in meaning of the terms delusion, illusion and hallucination in the separate traditions of neurology and psychiatry. Psychiatry makes clear distinctions between the terms and has focussed on the empirical use of descriptive psychopathology in order to delineate the various psychiatric syndromes, including those in epilepsy. These distinctions in psychiatry have stood the test of time and are useful in clinical descriptive terms, but do not help to understand the basic mechanisms. The focus of neurology has been to regard delusions, illusions and hallucinations in epilepsy as a result of localised or network based neuronal epileptic activity that can be investigated especially using intracranial stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). The neurological approach leads to a more synoptical definition of 'hallucination' than in psychiatry and to the conclusion that there is little point in differentiating hallucination from illusion or delusion in view of the overlap in the physiological bases of the phenomena. The semiologically derived differentiation of these terms in psychiatry is not supported by similarly discrete electrophysiological signatures. However, as discussed in the second paper, some psychotic states are associated with similar electrophysiological changes. The wide range of hallucinatory symptoms occurring during epileptic seizures recorded during intracranial SEEG and brain stimulation are reviewed here, including: experiential and interpretive phenomena, affective symptoms, as well as auditory, olfactory, gustatory, somatic and visual hallucinatory phenomena. Several conclusions can be drawn. First, it is clear that there is only limited anatomical specificity of many hallucinatory states. Repeated seizures or stimulation of a single area, even within the same patient can produce different psychic responses, whilst stimulation of widely distinct areas (especially in the limbic system) within the same individual can produce remarkably similar phenomena. This lack of specificity applies particularly to psychic symptoms, including experiential phenomena, and complex hallucinatory states. The most anatomically specific areas from this point of view are the elementary hallucinations arising from primary visual and auditory cortices. Involvement of the limbic cortex is a pre-requisite for the occurrence of complex hallucinatory states. It is clear that on the basis of these findings, as has been recognised at least since the 1960s, that even apparently focal epileptic seizures, (especially in the mesial temporal lobe, insula and limbic cortices), must involve widely distributed neuronal networks. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

vagus nerve stimulation","About one third of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy do not achieve seizure control despite medical therapy and should be assessed in detail to confirm the diagnosis, to determine the epilepsy syndrome and to plan treatment strategy. Refractory epilepsy is established when there is inadequate seizure control despite using potentially effective antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at tolerable levels for 1-2 years, and excluding nonepileptic events and poor compliance. An overview of patient management in everyday clinical practice is given. Risk factors for refractoriness include (1) generalized epilepsy with lesions; (2) focal epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, cortical dysplasia or hemorrhages; (3) early epilepsy onset; (4) high seizure frequency; (5) absence of response to the first 2 AEDs; (6) high frequency of interictal spikes, and (7) multifocal spikes. The efficacy of surgery ranges from curative (resection) to palliative (vagus nerve stimulation, callosotomy, multiple subpial transections) depending on the epilepsy syndrome and etiology. Using a new antiepileptic drug benefits about one third of patients. Refractoriness is constitutive in most patients and shows a progressive or remission-relapse course in others. As the transporter and target hypotheses do not entirely explain refractoriness, other hypotheses are emerging. New treatments under investigation are described. Copyright © 2009 S.

A fairly significant proportion of children remain refractory to current antiepileptic drugs, and may require alternative treatment options. Challenges also arise because many of the antiepileptic drugs available for use since 1993 are US FDA approved only for use over the age of 2-4 years, hence presenting a medicolegal conundrum to the treating physician. However, their more favorable side-effect profile and tolerability have led to their widespread use even in those less than 2 years of age.

Techniques are presented for eliciting, recording, and quantifying three major cognitive components with confirmed clinical utility: mismatch negativity (MMN), P300, and N400. Also highlighted are applications of each of the components as methods of investigating central nervous system pathology. The guidelines are intended to assist investigators who use ERPs in clinical research, in an effort to provide clear and concise recommendations and thereby to standardize methodology and facilitate comparability of data across laboratories. © 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",Click here for full text options,,,,

temporal lobe epilepsy / etiology / surgery","Purpose: Recent evidence suggesting that some epilepsy surgery failures could be related to unrecognized insular epilepsy have led us to lower our threshold to sample the insula with intracerebral electrodes. In this study, we report our experience resulting from this change in strategy. Method(s): During the period extending from October 2004 to June 2007, 18 patients had an intracranial study including 10 with insular coverage. The decision to sample the insula with intracerebral electrodes was made in the context of (1) nonlesional parietal lobe-like epilepsy; (2) nonlesional frontal lobe-like epilepsy; (3) nonlesional temporal lobe-like epilepsy; and (4) atypical temporal lobe-like epilepsy. Result(s): Intracerebral recordings confirmed the presence of insular lobe seizures in four patients. Cortical stimulation performed in 9 of 10 patients with insular electrodes elicited, in decreasing order of frequency, somatosensory, viscerosensory, motor, auditory, vestibular, and speech symptoms. Discussion(s): Our results suggest that insular cortex epilepsy may mimic temporal, frontal, and parietal lobe epilepsies and that a nonnegligeable proportion of surgical candidates with drug-resistant epilepsy have an epileptogenic zone that involves the insula. © 2008 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The validity of this method to localize the primary motor field in a pediatric tumor case was confirmed by intraoperative direct cortical stimulation. Currently, the reliability of this method has not been demonstrated. We report on a 16-year-old boy with localization-related epilepsy originating from his right hemisphere sensory cortex. Hand motor and sensory areas were identified preoperatively by ERB analysis of MEG data. The patient underwent invasive monitoring which localized the epileptic focus to right postcentral gyrus, immediately posterior to the MEG motor area and adjacent to the MEG sensory area. The patient received a gyrectomy of sensory cortex guided by intraoperative direct cortical stimulation to ensure sparing of hand motor cortex. Replication of the MEG motor mapping protocol postoperatively demonstrated reliable localization of the motor and sensory areas. We also discuss caveats for future applications of this protocol.

Neurological problems presenting to acute physicians were highlighted: stroke risk and prevention following transient ischaemic attacks; an update on stroke thrombolysis; when to refer stroke patients to regional neuroscience centres; and epilepsy and its neurological and cardiac mimics. At the other end of the spectrum, the management of chronic neurological disease, including Parkinson's disease, and end-of-life neurology care were reviewed. Updates on developing patient-centred services for people with neurological impairments were presented. Finally there was a practical guide to driving regulations in a variety of clinical scenarios. © 2009 Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.",Click here for full text options,,,,

To help achieve a better understanding of these mechanisms, we studied the extra-cellular electrically evoked responses in the hippocampi of mice during rapid kindling. Kindling protocol was achieved by stimulating the dorsal right hippocampus six times daily for four days using bipolar electrodes to produce sub-convulsive electrical discharges. Motor responses and analyzed electroencephalographic recordings showed progression from partial complex seizures to generalized seizures associated with different consecutive patterns within the afterdischarges. A spike-wave pattern appeared immediately after stimulation in combination with a poly-spike complex superimposed over the wave (AD1). AD1 was followed by a poly-spike complex (AD2), which was followed by a progressive modification of repetitive spikes (AD3). An ictal depression event was observed at the end of each AD3. Theta oscillations were observed at stage 1-2 of kindling, while beta/gamma oscillations appeared within AD2, associated with stage 4-5 from Racine's score. Benzodiazepine, a GABA (A) agonist (Diazepam) administered at non-sedative doses and only on days 3 and 4 of kindling, limited beta and gamma frequency bands and the progression of seizure severity, suggesting that the failure of GABA (A) agonism mediates the propagation or generalization of seizures. We conclude that different phases of afterdischarge occur during kindling and that high frequencies mediate generalization of seizures. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Intracortical disinhibitory mechanisms play a crucial role in epilepsy. Therefore, the recruitment of motor cortical excitability was evaluated to distinct between focal and generalized epileptic syndromes. Twenty-five untreated patients with epilepsy and 20 controls were enrolled. Classification into focal (FE, n = 10) or idiopathic generalized (IGE, n = 15) epilepsy was based on seizure semiology, EEG and MRI. The recruitment of motor cortical inhibition and facilitation was measured by varying the stimulus intensity (SI) of the first conditioning stimulus in a paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm producing stimulus-response (S-R) curves of intracortical excitability. S-R curves were then compared with other commonly used TMS measures of cortical excitability [cortical silent period (CSP) and motor threshold (MT)]. In patients with IGE, inhibition occurred only at higher conditioning SIs compared to patients with focal epilepsy and controls. Recruitment of inhibition was unchanged in patients with focal epilepsy compared to controls. Recruitment of facilitation (ICF), CSP duration and MT, were not different between patients with FE or IGE or between patients and controls. These results suggest that the recruitment for motor cortical inhibition in patients with IGE is less effective. This may reflect a disturbed access to or an increased threshold of inhibitory neurons within the motor cortex. Impaired recruitment of inhibition might be a helpful parameter to access cortical excitability in newly diagnosed patients with generalized or focal epilepsy. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

treatment outcome","A large number of animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are already available for studies on mechanisms and experimental treatments of TBI. Immediate and early seizures have been described in many of these models with focal or mixed type (both gray and white matter damage) injury. Recent long-term video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring studies have demonstrated that TBI produced by lateral fluid-percussion injury in rats results in the development of late seizures, that is, epilepsy. These animals develop hippocampal alterations that are well described in status epilepticus-induced spontaneous seizure models and human posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE). In addition, these rats have damage ipsilaterally in the cortical injury site and thalamus. Although studies in the trauma field provide a large amount of information about the molecular and cellular alterations corresponding to the immediate and early phases of PTE, chronic studies relevant to the epileptogenesis phase are sparse. Moreover, despite the multiple preclinical pharmacologic and cell therapy trials, there is no information available describing whether these therapeutic approaches aimed at improving posttraumatic recovery would also affect the development of lowered seizure threshold and epilepsy. To make progress, there is an obvious need for information exchange between the trauma and epilepsy fields. In addition, the inclusion of epilepsy as an outcome measure in preclinical trials aiming at improving somatomotor and cognitive recovery after TBI would provide valuable information about possible new avenues for antiepileptogenic interventions and disease modification after TBI. © 2009 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,carisbamate / drug therapy [drug term],,,

Many previous studies support that stimulation of the motor cortex with short-train pulses is a less epileptogenic alternative to the 50-60 Hz 'Penfield' technique. However, whether the short-train stimulation is useful also in mapping of speech areas is unclear. In this case report we present a patient with oligodendroglioma near the Broca area. Extraoperative electrical stimulation via a subdural grid electrode was primarily performed to locate the speech area. The cortex was stimulated with short-train pulses (5 pulses, 0.5 pulse duration and 3 ms interpulse interval) in addition to 1-3 s 50 Hz stimulation. The patient had speech arrest from both types of stimulation techniques during a naming task. It was however critical that the short (14.5 ms) train stimulation was synchronized with the presentation of the naming objects. If not, there was no speech arrest. Despite this possible pitfall, this case has encouraged us to further try short-train stimulation in attempts to reduce stimulus-triggered seizures during mapping of eloquent areas. © 2009 British Epilepsy Association.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Frontotemporal spikes showed more frequent STN propagation (70%), shorter delays, and progressive spread from ventral to dorsal contacts than temporal spikes.

Effective treatment strategies involve matching the characteristics of drug and patient to control seizures without adverse effects, a task that requires familiarity with the potential advantages and drawbacks of individual antiseizure drugs. For medically refractory partial epilepsy, resective surgical procedures should be considered. If the patient is not a surgical candidate, the vagus nerve stimulator or ketogenic diet may improve seizure control in selected cases. Emerging therapies include medications with novel mechanisms of action, deep brain stimulators, and cortical stimulators that respond to neural patterns of seizure activity. © Current Medicine Group, LLC 2009.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The number of treatment options has become large, and evidence of effectiveness for each treatment continues to expand. To address this problem, numerous guidelines have been produced by several societies and organizations. However, the guidelines do not always agree in their recommendations, mostly because of differing methods reflecting distinct purposes, but these differences are useful because they highlight both what is incontrovertible and what is unknown. Overall, the evidence needed to choose an antiepileptic drug (AED) wisely is incomplete, and no individual AED or group of AEDs is universally preferred as first-line therapy. Initial treatment should be based in part on the seizure-type diagnosis because the AEDs differ in their efficacy for various seizure types. The AEDs also differ in their safety, tolerability, and potential for pharmacologic interactions. These issues and the patient's general medical history are additional factors to be used when selecting an AED. The failure of AEDs to completely control seizures should lead to consideration of epilepsy surgery, especially for patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. However, there is no consensus regarding how many AEDs should be tried before the condition is deemed pharmacoresistant. Vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet are alternative treatments for patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy who do not have epilepsy surgery or who have unsuccessful surgery. © Current Medicine Group, LLC 2009.",Click here for full text options,,,,

""Awake craniotomy"" is a technique to conserve function during brain tumor surgery. We report on the combination of these 2 techniques, with special emphasis on potential adverse effects, caveats, and patient preparation. Method(s): Thirty-four patients had 38 awake craniotomies with cortical stimulation within an integrated MRI-operating room with a 1.5-T unit. Thirty-two lesions were left hemispheric, 6 on the right side. Result(s): Preparation for iMRI per patient amounted to 20 to 25 minutes, in addition to scan time. The procedure was well tolerated by all patients. Thirty-two stated that they would undergo this procedure again, if necessary. Four underwent a second ""awake"" surgery in the iMRI for recurrent disease. Intraoperative MRI had no adverse effect, such as seizures. Cortical stimulation could be performed without restrictions outside the 5-gauss line. Conclusion(s): The combination of iMRI and awake craniotomy is demanding but well tolerated by patients. Careful preoperative evaluation is essential to ensure compliance. There is no adverse effect through iMRI on the awake patient or the results of cortical stimulation.Since the introduction of the iMRI in our department in 2005, all awake craniotomies were done in this setting. The implementation of these 2 techniques into our procedures is demanding, and necessitates thorough preparation but has broadened our basis for surgical decision making. However, to substantiate our positive perception, more clinical data are being compiled. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.",Click here for full text options,*awake craniotomy [other term],,,

treatment outcome","Objective: In certain chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) conditions, extradural electrode implantation is preferred to a subdural location for motor cortex stimulation (MCS) therapy, but the rationale for this preference remains debatable. We provide documented long-term results of subdural MCS in CNP. METHOD(S): Our eight consecutive patients (five men, three women; age range, 45-81 yr) had either central or peripheral CNP. We localized the central sulcus using anatomic landmarks and three-dimensional neuronavigation and by detecting the N20 wave inversion. We then created an elongated craniotomy (3 cm long x 1 cm wide), followed by a linear incision of the dura. An eight-polar plate electrode was slipped in subdurally. We used motor-evoked potentials to choose the optimal electrode position before fixing the electrode to the dura. RESULT(S): Six patients had favorable outcomes, and two had poor outcomes at the time of the last assessment (mean, 54 mo; range, 19-69 mo). Three patients experienced five transient complications, each having an episode of partial motor seizure, one that evolved into a secondary generalized seizure. Seizures were related to an abrupt increase in stimulation intensity. Two of these three patients also had hardware infections that required system replacement, with the electrode implanted extradurally at the second implantation in one case because of severe arachnoiditis. This change necessitated a greater intensity and a longer duration of stimulation to deliver a therapeutic effect equivalent to that with subdural MCS. CONCLUSION(S): In this small series, subdural MCS seemed a tolerable approach in the long term for CNP patients. In addition, subdural MCS provided a therapeutic effect comparable to that obtained with extradural placement.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Several investigators in previous experimental and clinical studies have used stimulation of various anatomical targets with promising results. In this chapter, the authors present their experience with a novel, implantable, local closed-loop responsive neuro-stimulation system (RNS) (Neuropace, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). This system consists of a cranially implanted pulse generator, one or two quadripolar subdural strip or depth leads and an external programmer. The system components and technical characteristics are presented. The criteria for selecting candidates for implantation as well as the preliminary results of a clinical trial are also presented. Closed-loop stimulation system appears to be a safe treatment option with promising results for the management of patients with well-localized, focal medically-refractory epilepsy, who are not candidates for surgical resection.",Click here for full text options,,,,

United States","Overt status epilepticus and persistent obtundation after a witnessed clinical seizure are neurologic emergencies. Early recognition and intervention in the electroclinical syndrome of status epilepticus reduces morbidity, although treatment of the underlying etiology is also critical. This review outlines key concepts related to status epilepticus, delineates an approach to the early management of status epilepticus, and highlights novel but practical approaches in the evaluation and treatment of refractory status epilepticus, emphasizing the use of a treatment algorithm. This review is written from the perspective of the intensive care unit clinician, and the approach and opinions expressed stem from clinical experience and review of the current literature. Particular attention is given to an overall approach to the management of convulsive status epilepticus in adults and older children as well as exploring novel approaches and diagnostic tools that may prove useful in difficult-to-control status epilepticus.

xerostomia / side effect","Background: Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common tremor disorders in adults and is characterized by kinetic and postural tremor. To develop this practice parameter, the authors reviewed available evidence regarding initiation of pharmacologic and surgical therapies, duration of their effect, their relative benefits and risks, and the strength of evidence supporting their use. Method(s): A literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and CINAHL was performed to identify clinical trials in patients with ET published between 1966 and August 2004. Articles were classified according to a four-tiered level of evidence scheme and recommendations were based on the level of evidence. Results and Conclusion(s): Propranolol and primidone reduce limb tremor (Level A). Alprazolam, atenolol, gabapentin (monotherapy), sotalol, and topiramate are probably effective in reducing limb tremor (Level B). Limited studies suggest that propranolol reduces head tremor (Level B). Clonazepam, clozapine, nadolol, and nimodipine possibly reduce limb tremor (Level C). Botulinum toxin A may reduce hand tremor but is associated with dose-dependent hand weakness (Level C). Botulinurn toxin A may reduce head tremor (Level C) and voice tremor (Level C), but breathiness, hoarseness, and swallowing difficulties may occur in the treatment of voice tremor. Chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) (Level C) and thalamotomy (Level C) are highly efficacious in reducing tremor. Each procedure carries a small risk of major complications. Some adverse events from DBS may resolve with time or with adjustment of stimulator settings. There is insufficient evidence regarding the surgical treatment of head and voice tremor and the use of gamma knife thalamotomy (Level U). Additional prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to better determine the efficacy and side effects of pharmacologic and surgical treatments of ET.

Diagnosis of epilepsy remains clinical, and neurophysiological investigations support the diagnosis of the syndrome. Brain imaging is able to identify many of the structural causes of the epilepsies. Current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) block seizures without influencing the underlying tendency to generate seizures, and are effective in 60-70% of individuals. Several modern drugs are as efficacious as the older medications, but have important advantages including the absence of adverse drug interactions and hypersensitivity reactions. Epilepsy is associated with an increased prevalence of mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. An understanding of the psychiatric correlates of epilepsy is important to the adequate management of people with epilepsy. Anticipation of common errors in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy is important. Frequent early diagnostic errors include nonepileptic psychogenic seizures, syncope with myoclonus, restless legs syndrome, and REM behavioral disorders, the last mostly in elderly men. Overtreatment with too rapid titration and too high doses or too many AEDs should be avoided. For people with refractory focal epilepsy, vagus nerve stimulation offers palliative treatment with possible mood improvement and neurosurgical resection offers the possibility of a life-changing cure. Potential advances in the management of epilepsy are briefly discussed. This short review summarizes the authors' how-to-do approach to the modern management of people with epilepsy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated the feasibility, efficacy and safety of long-term anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) stimulation for intractable epilepsy. Method(s): In this open-label pilot study of electrical stimulation of the ATN, we investigated four cases of intractable epilepsy (one man with generalized seizure, and three woman with partial seizure and secondary generalization; age range, 18-45 years), with a follow up of 2 years. Under the indication of bilateral or nonlocalized epileptic foci, each patient underwent stereotactic implantation of a quadripolar stimulating electrode in the bilateral ATN, guided by single-unit microelectrode recording. The stimulator was turned on after a sham period of 2-4 weeks. Seizure frequency was monitored and compared with the pre-implantation baseline. Twenty-one similar cases reported in the literature during the past 20 years were reviewed. Result(s): Insertion into and stimulation through electrodes implanted in the ATN decreased seizure frequency, with a mean reduction rate of 49.6% in the current series. Two patients had seizure reductions of >= 60%, with complete remission achieved in one patient. These findings were consistent with those in four other investigations of intractable epilepsy, which showed an overall rate of 45-55% in seizure reduction. One of our patients suffered a small frontal hemorrhage, and a second patient had extension erosion over the scalp; however, no resultant major or permanent neurological deficits were observed. Conclusion(s): Based on our study results and literature review, it appears reasonable to conclude that long-term ATN stimulation is a safe and effective treatment for seizure reduction in patients with intractable epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

vagus nerve stimulation","Epilepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent and unprovoked seizures (Dreifuss, 1987; Hauser & Hesdorffer, 1990). It is one of the most common neurologic disorders in the adult. The lifetime risk of developing epilepsy is 3.2% (Mattson, 1992). Approximately 90% of the incident cases in adults have symptomatic partial or localization-related epilepsy (Camfield & Camfield, 1996; Hauser & Hesdorffer, 1990; Hauser, 1992). The medial temporal lobe is the most epileptogenic region of the brain (Luby et al., 1995; Jeong et al., 1999; Wiebe et al., 2001). Pathologic lesions underlying the epileptogenic zone include mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), tumor, vascular anomaly, malformations of cortical development (MCDs), and head trauma (Cascino et al., 1993; Radhakrishnan et al., 1998). The initial response to medication is of prognostic importance (Hauser, 1992). Patients with a remote symptomatic neurologic disease, foreign-tissue lesion, developmental delay, or abnormal neurologic examination are less likely to be rendered seizure-free. The goals of treatment are to render the individual seizure-free without producing antiepileptic drug (AED) toxicity, allowing the individual to become a participating and productive member of society (Engel & Ojemann, 1993). Despite the introduction of ""newer"" AEDs, nearly one-half of patients with partial epilepsy will not attain a seizure remission with pharmacotherapy (Kwan & Brodie, 2003). This discussion focuses on management of the adult patient with intractable partial seizure disorders that are medically refractory and may not be surgically remediable. It is estimated that 400,000 of the 2 million individuals with partial epilepsy in the United States have a medically refractory partial seizure disorder (Hauser & Hesdorffer, 1990; Hauser, 1992). An estimated 1,500 patients in the United States undergo epilepsy surgery each year. A UK study indicated that 30,000 patients develop epilepsy each year and approximately 6,000 have medically refractory seizures (Lhatoo et al., 2003). However, there are only about 400 epilepsy surgeries performed annually in the UK. Therefore, the number of patients with intractable partial epilepsy that is both medically refractory and possibly not a surgically remediable epileptic syndrome is significant. © 2008 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,atkins diet [other term],,,

Adrian Upton in 1985 proposed deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for the treatment of seizures and psychosis [Cooper I.S., Upton A.R.: Biol Psychiatry 1985;20:811-813]. Francisco Velasco, in 1987, introduced DBS of the thalamic centromedian nucleus, proposing its employment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and for multifocal epilepsy. Other proposed targets are the subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, Forel fields and mammillothalamic tract. We employed DBS for stimulating 2 'unconventional targets', the posterior hypothalamus (pHyp) and caudal zona incerta (CZi), for the treatment of 2 patients with multifocal epilepsy and behavioural comorbidity, and 2 patients with sensorimotor focal seizures, respectively. Such patients did not meet criteria for resective surgery. Material(s) and Method(s): In our institution, between January 2003 and May 2004, we started DBS in 2 epileptic patients The former patient was affected by multifocal epilepsy, and the second one by refractory partial motor and secondary generalized seizures. The chosen targets were the pHyp in the former case and the CZi in the latter. The encouraging results obtained led us to replicate such a favourable experience in 2 more patients, 1 with focal motor epilepsy once again (resulting in status epilepticus) and the other with behavioural comorbidity and multifocal epilepsy. Result(s): A significant reduction in seizure frequency was observed, and the 2 patients with behavioural comorbidity also showed a dramatic improvement in their disruptive behaviour. The patient with motor focal seizures showed a 70% reduction in seizure frequency, and in the last patient remission from status epilepticus was obtained. Conclusion(s): Our data confirm DBSof deep brain structures modulates the functional activity of the cerebral cortex as suggested by Adrian Upton in 1985. In the reported series, deep-brain stimulation of 2 unconventional targets belonging to the reticulo-cortical system (the brainstem-diencephalon functional system including structures that act as remote controls in modulating cortical excitability) was found to be effective in controlling otherwise refractory multifocal (pHyp) and focal sensorimotor (CZi) epilepsy when resective surgery was not feasible.

Material et methods: Studies were conducted from observations of patients with drug-resistant seizures and treated with neuromodulation. Seizures originated from various cortical areas with secondary generalization or were initially generalized without a focal origin, either clinically or on EEG or SEEG. Intracranial recordings and SEEG were performed using subdural grids or depth electrodes implanted either for recordings or therapeutic deep brain stimulation (DBS). In a group of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients investigated with subdural or SEEG electrodes, the epileptogenic focus area was stimulated for 15 days before anterior temporal lobectomy. The surgical specimen was examined using standard and electronic microscopy and autoradiography in order to identify several neurotransmitter receptors. They also were compared to other surgical specimens from epileptic patients who had intracerebral recordings but without stimulation (epileptic controls) and to autopsy specimens from subjects with no history of epilepsy (nonepileptic controls). Result(s): High-frequency (HF) stimulation increases the after-discharge threshold of the stimulated site and alters the cycles of potentials evoked by a test stimulation using a paradigm of coupled stimulations. HF stimulation also decreases local cerebral blood flow in the stimulated area as demonstrated on SPECT. Parahippocampal cortex HF stimulation significantly increases the GABAergic benzodiazepine receptor density in the stimulated area. In addition, centromedianum (CM) thalamic nucleus HF stimulation suppresses thalamic and cortical spike-waves, as well as secondary synchronous discharges visible on EEG. Conversely, low-frequency (3-Hz) bilateral CM stimulation induces a typical absence clinically and on EEG. Conclusion(s): High-frequency stimulation is responsible for an inhibition of local and propagated epileptogenesis. Low-frequency stimulation may trigger or enhance epileptogenesis when applied on epileptogenic regions. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Electrical activity at very low and very high frequencies, beyond the practical range of scalp EEG, can be recorded subdurally and may contain considerable information not available non-invasively. The recording and stimulating procedures for using chronically implanted subdural electrodes to localize the epileptogenic zone and map eloquent functions of the human cortex are well established, and complication rates are low. Complications include infections, CSF leak, and focal neurologic deficits, all of which tend to be increased with a higher number of electrodes and longer duration of recordings. Careful consideration of the risks and benefits should be coupled with a firm hypothesis about the epileptogenic zone derived from the non-invasive components of the epilepsy workup to guide the decision about whether and where to implant subdural electrodes. When they are employed to answer a specific question in an individual patient, subdural electrodes can optimize the clinical outcome of a candidate for epilepsy surgery.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The unexpected finding of the investigations was that intracerebral, high frequency (50 Hz) electrical stimulation (HFS) triggered the emergence of automatic and involuntary forward-backward locomotion during a focal seizure while the boy was standing. This clinical manifestation was different from the chaotic motor activity described during epileptic wanderings. The stimulation of the same fronto-lateral region, while the patient was lying, produced only the subjective sensation that the legs were moving, although there was no physical manifestation of this. Human locomotion is an innate motor behavior that is normally due to the activation of the spinal network for locomotion (central pattern generator). The emergence of different stereotyped motor behaviors during focal epileptic seizures or sleep disorders has recently been interpreted as a release of subcortical central pattern generators (Tassinari et al. 2005). In view of this, we hypothesize that the involuntary and robot-like locomotion of our patient could be the ictal expression of the release of subcortical locomotor CPGs.",Click here for full text options,,,,

In individuals with refractory focal epilepsy, neurosurgery can have a 60-70% chance of bringing long-term remission and these cases should be referred to a specialised centre for evaluation. The standard evaluation includes clinical review, brain imaging with magnetic resonance imaging, recording of seizures with prolonged scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and video, neuropsychological and psychiatric assessments. The aim is to establish converging evidence that there is a single epileptic focus and that the rest of the brain is functioning normally. In some individuals further evaluation with functional imaging and intracranial EEG recordings may be necessary. The most commonly performed resective operation is an anterior temporal lobe resection to remove a sclerotic hippocampus, followed by lesionectomies and neocortical resections. Palliative manoeuvres, to reduce seizure frequency and severity include corpus callosotomy, subpial transection and vagal nerve stimulation.",Click here for full text options,"corpus callosotomy [other term]

Student t test","Objective: We determined whether the primary motor hand area was most frequently located in the precentral gyrus in young patients with intractable focal seizures. Method(s): Sixty-five patients with focal seizures aged between 5 months and 20 years who underwent a two-stage epilepsy surgery using chronic subdural-EEG monitoring were studied. Pairs of subdural electrodes were electrically stimulated, and the brain region with contralateral hand movement induced by the lowest-intense stimulus was defined as the primary motor hand area. Result(s): Contralateral hand movement was induced without afterdischarges in 50 children but not in the remaining 15 children. The unpaired t-test revealed that failure to induce contralateral hand motor movement was associated with younger age of subjects. Among the 50 patients with a positive motor response, the primary motor hand area was confined to the precentral gyrus in 9 patients, confined to the postcentral gyrus in 24, and located in both the pre- and post-central gyri in the remaining 17. The McNemar's test revealed that the observed frequency of 24 patients showing the primary motor hand area confined to the postcentral gyrus was larger than chance frequency. Logistic regression analysis failed to demonstrate that the observation of the primary motor hand area confined to the postcentral gyrus was associated with the age, the presence of dysplastic lesion or the seizure onset involving the frontal lobe. Conclusion(s): Our study failed to support the traditionally-accepted notion that the primary motor hand area is most frequently located in the precentral gyrus but rather demonstrated that a substantial proportion of young patients had the primary motor hand area in the postcentral gyrus. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this review, we suggest that they can be combined to answer important questions about selforganising systems like the brain. DCM has been developed recently by the neuroimaging community to explain, using biophysical models, the non-invasive brain imaging data are caused by neural processes. It allows one to ask mechanistic questions about the implementation of cerebral processes. In DCM the parameters of biophysical models are estimated from measured data and the evidence for each model is evaluated. This enables one to test different functional hypotheses (i.e., models) for a given data set. Autopoiesis and related formal theories of biological systems as autonomous machines represent a body of concepts with many successful applications. However, autopoiesis has remained largely theoretical and has not penetrated the empiricism of cognitive neuroscience. In this review, we try to show the connections that exist between DCM and autopoiesis. In particular, we propose a simple modification to standard formulations of DCM that includes autonomous processes. The idea is to exploit the machinery of the system identification of DCMs in neuroimaging to test the face validity of the autopoietic theory applied to neural subsystems. We illustrate the theoretical concepts and their implications for interpreting electroencephalographic signals acquired during amygdala stimulation in an epileptic patient. The results suggest that DCM represents a relevant biophysical approach to brain functional organisation, with a potential that is yet to be fully evaluated.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Famous examples of such exploration have unveiled various unexpected response properties, such as those of mirror neurons. This approach, which relies on the possibility to test online the reactivity of precise neural populations has no equivalent so far in humans. The present study proposes and applies a radically novel framework for mapping human brain functions in ecological situations based on a combination of a) exploratory sessions, using real-time electrophysiology to formulate hypotheses about the functional role of precise cortical regions and b) controlled experimental protocols specifically adapted to test these hypotheses. Using this two-stage approach with an epileptic patient candidate for surgery and implanted with intracerebral electrodes, we were able to precisely map high-level auditory functions in the patients' superior temporal lobe. We propose that this procedure constitutes at the least a useful complement of electrical cortical stimulations to map eloquent brain areas in epileptic patients before their surgery, but also a path of discovery for human functional brain mapping.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Our findings illustrate that stimulation of the left temporo-parieto-occipital junction may activate networks of visual perception (color, pattern, movement, rotation, shape, and memory) independent of the cortical hierarchy from elementary to complex information. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Method(s): Nine patients were included. All had refractory partial complex seizures, some with secondary generalizations. All patients had a 3-month-baseline-seizure count, after which they underwent bilateral hippocampal diagnostic electrode implantation to establish focus laterality and location. Three patients had bilateral, and six, unilateral foci. Diagnostic electrodes were explanted and definitive Medtronic electrodes were implanted directed into the hippocampal foci. Position was confirmed with MRI and afterwards, the deep brain stimulation system internalized. Patients signed the informed consent approved by the Hospital's Ethics Committee and began a double-blind stimulation protocol. Patients attended a medical appointment every 3 months for seizure diary collection, deep brain stimulation system checkup, and neuropsychological testing. Result(s): Follow-up ranged from 18 months to 7 years. Patients were divided in two groups: five had normal MRIs and seizure reduction of >95%, while four had hippocampal sclerosis and seizure reduction of 50-70%. No patient had neuropsychological deterioration, nor did any patient show side effects. Three patients were explanted after 2 years due to skin erosion in the trajectory of the system. Conclusion(s): Electrical stimulation of the hippocampus provides a nonlesional method that improves seizure outcome without memory deterioration in patients with hippocampal epileptic foci. © 2007 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Behavioral toxic effects were assessed at 30 min following drug administration using scores on a sedation/muscle relaxation rating index. In response to suprathreshold stimulation, the anticonvulsant efficacy of the drugs were evaluated from measurements of afterdischarge duration (ADD) and behavioral seizure severity (SS) during a repeated drug treatment schedule in kindled guinea-pigs. All drugs exerted slight to moderate sedative effects in guinea-pigs on our rating index. We found that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital exhibited effective anticonvulsant properties in kindled guinea-pigs by reducing both ADD and SS. We found that valproate consistently reduced ADD throughout the treatment schedule but failed to significantly reduce SS. Lastly, ethosuximide failed to exhibit effective anticonvulsant properties. Our results indicate that the guinea-pig kindling model correctly predicted the actions of these common anticonvulsant drugs in the treatment of partial seizures. Guinea-pig amygdala kindling appears to serve as a useful and valid model for partial epilepsy. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Click here for full text options,repeated drug dose [other term],,,"Abbott

Method(s): Forty-three patients with drug-resistant epilepsy from eight Italian Centers underwent a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study on the clinical and EEG effects of slow rTMS. The stimulus frequency was 0.3 Hz. One thousand stimuli per day were given at the resting motor threshold intensity for 5 consecutive days, with a round coil at the vertex. Result(s): ""Active"" rTMS was no better than placebo for seizure reduction. However, it decreased interictal EEG epileptiform abnormalities significantly (p < 0.05) in one-third of the patients, which supports a detectable biologic effect. No correlation linked the rTMS effects on seizure frequency to syndrome or anatomic classification, seizure type, EEG changes, or resting motor threshold (an index of motor cortex excitability). Conclusion(s): Although the antiepileptic action was not significant (p > 0.05), the individual EEG reactivity to ""active"" rTMS may be encouraging for the development of more-powerful, noninvasive neuromodulatory strategies. © 2007 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ANT has been reported to decrease seizure activity in a limited number of human subjects. However, long-term effect of chronic ANT stimulation on such patients remains unknown. We report long-term follow-up results in four patients receiving ANT stimulation for intractable epilepsy. Method(s): Four patients underwent stereotactic implantation of quadripolar stimulating electrodes in the bilateral ANT, guided by single-unit microelectrode recording. Electrode location was confirmed by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The stimulator was activated 2-4 weeks following electrode insertion; initial stimulation parameters were 4-5 V, 90-110 Hz, and 60-90 mus. Seizure frequency was monitored and compared with preimplantation baseline frequency. Intelligence quotient (IQ) test and auditory P300 response were performed before and after implantation of electrodes. Result(s): Four patients (one man with generalized seizures, and three women with partial seizures and secondary generalization) aged 18-45 years old were studied with mean follow-up period of 43.8 months. The four patients demonstrated a sustained effect of 49% (range, 35-76%) seizure reduction to ANT stimulation. Simple insertion of DBS electrodes (Sham period, no stimulation) produced a mean reduction in seizures of 67% (range, 44-94%). One patient was seizure-free for 15 months with anticonvulsant medications. One patient had a small frontal hemorrhage and a second patient had extension erosion over scalp; no resultant major or permanent neurological deficit was observed. Preoperative IQ index and auditory P300 were not significantly different with those after electrodes implantation. Conclusion(s): Implantation of electrodes in the ANT and subsequent stimulation is associated with a significant reduction in seizure frequency. However, our study could not differentiate whether the implantation itself, the subsequent stimulation or postimplantation drug manipulation had the greatest impact. These experimental results prompt further controlled study in a large patient population. © 2007 International League Against Epilepsy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

We intended to describe the results of DBS on subthalamic nuclei and anterior thalamic nuclei (STN and ATN) from our patients and to evaluate the long-term efficiency and safety of DBS for controlling intractable epilepsy. METHOD(S): Six patients with refractory epilepsy and inadequate for surgery were implanted with DBS electrodes (3 in STN and 3 in ATN, respectively), switched on after a week of insertion followed by chronological observation. Seizure counts were monitored and compared with pre-implantation baseline. RESULT(S): There was significant clinical improvement in respect of reduction of seizure frequency as well as the alleviation of ictal severity in almost patients. The mean reduction in seizure frequency was 62.3% (49.1% from STN vs. 75.4% from ATN). Except one patient (patient 3) with accidental infection on the right anterior chest, no complication or withdrawal of DBS was seen during our study. CONCLUSION(S): DBS on STN and ATN demonstrated their clear efficiency and relative safety comparable or superior to previous studies during long term follow-up. Subsequent, well designed studies warrant the further increase of the knowledge about antiepileptic effect of DBS.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Depth electrodes recordings have shown that epileptiform activity can be generated within these lesions, and also at a distance in the neocortex. Heterotopia seem to be part of a more complex circuitry involving also the surrounding and distant cerebral cortex. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) changes to interictal spikes using continuous EEG and functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) can help to understand non-invasively the mechanisms of epileptogenicity in these patients. We studied 14 patients with epilepsy and heterotopia using simultaneous recording of EEG-fMRI. EEG was continuously acquired from inside the scanner during 2 h sessions. Epileptic spikes were visually identified in the filtered EEG and each type of spike determined one EEG-fMRI study. We looked at positive (activation) and negative (deactivation) changes in the BOLD signal. Eleven patients had nodular heterotopia and three band heterotopia. Four patients had more than one type of spikes, with a total of 26 EEG-fMRI studies. We excluded three with less than three spikes, and therefore a total of 23 studies (12 with nodular and 11 with band heterotopia) were analysed. Nodular heterotopia: Activation was present in nine studies, with involvement of the heterotopia or surrounding cortex in six, three of which had concomitant distant activation. Deactivation was also observed in nine studies, with involvement of the heterotopia and surrounding cortex in four, three of which had concomitant distant deactivation. Band heterotopia: Activation was present in all 11 studies, and always involved the heterotopia and surrounding cortex, 9 of which had concomitant distant activation. Deactivation was also observed in all 11 studies, with involvement of both the heterotopia and surrounding cortex, in addition to distant deactivation in 5 studies. EEG-fMRI studies reveal, non-invasively, metabolic responses in the heterotopia despite the fact that spikes are generated in the neocortex. The responses, activation or deactivation, had different correlation with the lesion and surrounding or distant cortex, activation reflecting intense neuronal activity, or excitation, and deactivation a possible distant (extra-lesional) inhibition. EEG-fMRI may become a useful tool to understand the epileptogenicity of such malformations. © The Author (2005). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain.

somatosensory cortex","Negative myoclonus (NM) is a motor disorder characterized by a sudden and abrupt interruption of muscular activity. The EMG correlate of NM is a brief (<500 ms) silent period (SP) not preceded by any enhancement of EMG activity (i.e. myoclonus). This study investigated the role of premotor cortex (PMC), primary motor cortex (MI), primary somatosensory area (SI) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in the pathophysiology of cortical NM by means of intracerebral low frequency (1 Hz) electrical stimulation. In three drug-resistant epileptic patients undergoing presurgical evaluation, we delivered single electric pulses (stimulus duration: 3 ms; stimulus intensity ranging from 0.4 to 3 mA) to PMC (2 patients), MI (1 patient), SI and SMA through stereo-EEG electrodes; surface EMG was collected from both deltoids. The results showed that (i) the stimulation of PMC or MI could evoke a motor evoked potential (MEP) either at rest or during contraction, in this latter case followed by an SP; however, in two patients, at the lowest stimulus intensities (0.4 mA), 50% of stimuli could induce a pure SP, i.e. not preceded by an MEP; raising the intensity of stimulation (0.6 mA), the SPs showed an antecedent MEP in >80% of stimuli; (ii) the stimulation of SI at low stimulus intensities (from 0.4 to 0.8 mA) induced in two patients only SPs, never associated with an antecedent MEP, whereas in the third subject the SPs could be inconstantly preceded by an MEP; by incrementing the stimulus intensity (up to 3 mA), in all three patients the SPs tended to be preceded, although not constantly, by an MEP; stimulus intensity affected SP duration (i.e. the higher the intensity, the longer the SP), without influencing the latency of onset of the SPs; (iii) the stimulation of SMA induced only pure SPs, at all stimulus intensities up to 3 mA; as for SI, increment of stimulus intensity was paralleled by an increase in SP duration, without influencing the onset latency of SPs. We conclude that single electric pulse stimulation of PMC, MI, SI and SMA through stereo-EEG electrodes can induce pure SPs, not preceded by an MEP, which clinically appear as NM, suggesting therefore that these cortical areas may be involved in the genesis of this motor phenomenon. However, it must be pointed out that SMA stimulation induced only pure SPs, regardless of the stimulus intensity, whereas occurrence of pure SPs following stimulation of PMC, MI, and SI depended mainly on the intensity of stimulation. © The Author (2005).

The benefit, seizure reduction, improved for at least 1 1/2 years with almost 50% of treated patients achieving about a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Other benefits are: seizure termination and improved mood. Benefits have been shown in children and adults with partial and generalized epilepsies, and in specific epilepsy syndromes. Implantation is easy. The method of action is largely unknown, although VNS appears to alter metabolic activity in specific brain nuclei. The improvement in mood has led to its approved use in patients with severe depression. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is under investigation as an alternate method for controlling medically refractory seizures. It is based on the observation that thalamic stimulation can influence the EEG over a wide area. Several thalamic nuclei, as well as the amygdala hippocampus complex, caudate nucleus, and substantia nigra, have been the object of stimulation, all holding promise in the treatment of medically refractory epilepsy. Intraoperative brain imaging is essential and the procedure is done under local anesthesia.

In the present study, LFECS was applied to the epileptic foci directly in four patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy through subdural electrodes and evaluated its effect on the number of interictal epileptiform discharges as well as simple partial seizures. We used alternating electric current of 0.3 ms duration presented at 0.9 Hz frequency for 250 s. LFECS did not induce seizures in any of the four patients. In one patient, the number of interictal epileptiform discharge decreased significantly by LFECS, which is in conformity with our previous report. In addition, LFECS applied to the seizure onset zone decreased the frequency of simple partial seizures in one patient. These results suggest that LFECS has an inhibitory effect not only on the interictal but also the ictal activities in patients with intractable partial epilepsy. Further study is required to determine the inhibitory effect of LFECS more in details. © 2006 British Epilepsy Association.",Click here for full text options,,,,

But the kindling effect might be different at different sites. Objective(s): To compare the features of animal models of complex partial epilepsy established through unilateral, bilateral and alternate-side kindling at hippocampus and successful rate of modeling among these 3 different ways. Design(s): A randomized and controlled animal experiment. Setting(s): Department of Neurology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University. Materials: Totally 60 healthy adult Wistar rats, weighing 200 to 300 g, of either gender, were used in this experiment. BL-410 biological functional experimental system (Taimeng Science and Technology Co. Ltd, Chengdu) and SE-7102 type electronic stimulator (Guangdian Company, Japan) were used in the experiment. Method(s): This experiment was carried out in the Experimental Animal Center of Shandong University from April to June 2004. After rats were anesthetized, electrode was implanted into the hippocampus. From the first day of measurement of afterdischarge threshold value, rats were given two-square-wave suprathreshold stimulation once per day with 400 alphaA intensity, 1ms wave length, 60 Hz frequency for 1 s duration. Left hippocampus was stimulated in unilateral kindling group, bilateral hippocampi were stimulated in bilateral kindling group, and left and right hippocampi were stimulated alternately every day in the alternate-side kindling group. Seizure intensity was scored: grade 0: normal, 1: wet dog-like shivering, facial spasm, such as, winking, touching the beard, rhythmic chewing and so on; 2: rhythmic nodding; 3: forelimb spasm;4: standing accompanied by bilateral forelimb spasm;5: tumbling, losing balance, four limbs spasm. Modeling was successful when seizure intensity reached grade 5. t test was used for the comparison of mean value between two samples. Main Outcome Measure(s): Comparison of the successful rate of modeling, the times of stimulation to reach intensity of grade 5, the lasting time of seizure of grade 3 of rats in each group. Result(s): Four rats of alternate-side kindling group dropped out due to infection-induced electrode loss, and 56 rats were involved in the result analysis. The successful rate of unilateral kindling group, bilateral kindling group and alternate-side kindling group was 55% (11/ 20),100% (16/16) and 100%(20/20), respectively. The stimuli to reach the grade 5 spasm were significantly more in the bilateral kindling group than in the unilateral kindling group [(30.63+/-3.48), (19.36 +/- 3.47) times, t=8.268,P < 0.01], and those were significantly fewer in the alternate-side kindling group than in the unilateral kindling group [(10.85+/-1.98)times, t=8.744,P < 0.01]. The duration of grade 3 spasm was significantly longer in the bilateral kindling group than in the unilateral kindling group [(9.75+/-2.59), (3.21+/-1.58) days, t=8.183, P < 0.01]. Among 20 successful rats of alternate-side kindling group, grade 5 spasm was found in the left hippocampi of 11 rats, but grade 3 spasm in their right hippocampi; Grade 5 spasm was found in the right hippocampi of the other 9 rats, grade 4 spasm in the left hippocampus of 1 rat and grade 3 of 8 rats. Conclusion(s): The speed of establishing epilepsy seizure model by alternate-side kindling is faster than that by unilateral kindling, while that by bilateral kindling is slower than that by unilateral kindling. The successful rate is very high to establish complex partial epilepsy with alternate-side or bilateral kindling. Epilepsy seizure established by alternate-side kindling has antagonistic effect of kindling and the seizure duration of grade 3 spasm is prolonged.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): This was an open treatment pilot study for subjects who had failed numerous medications and had seizure injuries. Seizure counts and adverse events were collected during a 3-4 month baseline, and for 26-32 months after DBS surgery, with AEDs held constant. Result(s): Case 1, age 45, with bitemporal seizures, had about half the seizure frequency but still fell with injuries.

Monopolar and bipolar stimulation delivered to the thalamic anterior nucleus using the programmable ITREL II stimulation device led to a significant decrease of cross power spectral density and a nonsignificant decrease of coherence in ipsilateral hippocampal structures. No such effect was found in lateral temporal or contralateral sites. The hippocampal inhibition was clearly related to the voltage (>=7 V) and frequency (>=70 Hz) of the thalamic stimulus and occurred with a delay of approximately 60 s after stimulus onset. © 2006 International League Against Epilepsy.,Click here for full text options,,,,

Using these electrodes, the attacks were recorded during a number of days and the cerebral cortex was electrically stimulated in order to map the functional areas. Design. Retrospective. Method. Data were collected from patients in whom subdural electrode grids had been placed between 1 September 1999 and 31 August 2004. All patients underwent a neurological examination and a neuropsychological test before the implantation. At the follow-up examination, the results with regard to function and the frequency of attacks were noted, as well as the complications. Results. Electrodes were placed in 22 patients: 9 women and 13 men with an average age of 27 years (range: 5-42). The implantation lasted for an average of 7 days (range: 3-10). In 4 patients, increased seizures during implantation required intravenous anticonvulsant treatment. Severe but transitory complications were seen in 4 patients (meningitis, subdural haematoma and ischaemia). 19 patients underwent a therapeutic resection. A postoperative decline in language skills was noted in 1 patient, while another 2 scored poorer in verbal tests. A permanent decline in sensorimotor function was seen in 1 patient, but this had been foreseen. Of the 16 operated patients with a duration of follow-up of at least 1 year, 10 were (practically) free of attacks, and another 3 patients had significantly fewer attacks. Conclusion. Registration with intracranial electrodes makes it possible to treat epileptic patients surgically by excision of brain tissue near critical areas. Such intensive monitoring is, however, not without risk and this must be weighed against the potential benefits.",Click here for full text options,,,Intracranieel EEG-onderzoek met elektrodematjes ten behoeve van epilepsiechirurgie; resultaten bij de eerste 22 patienten.,

Out of 30 patients who have been evaluated with chronically implanted subdural electrodes for medically intractable partial seizure or brain tumor involving the basal frontal or temporal cortex, 4 patients (age ranging 24-57 years) showed sensory and motor responses in the ipsilateral face to high frequency electrical cortical stimulation of the inferior fronto-temporal cortex. We investigated motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the facial muscle by single pulse stimulation in 2 out of 4 patients. Three patients showed both sensory symptoms and muscle contraction in the ipsilateral lower face when the orbitofrontal or basal temporal cortex was stimulated with 50 Hz electric current. One patient had only sensory symptoms in the lower face when ipsilateral basal temporal area was stimulated. MEPs at the left orbicularis oris muscle were constantly elicited with the onset latency of 7 ms throughout the stimulus rate of 2-30 Hz in 1 patient out of 2 patients was tested. In another patient, MEP onset latency was 3.0 ms with 11 Hz stimulation. With electrical stimulation of the basal fronto-temporal cortex, the ipsilateral facial twitch might occur through either the direct activation of the facial nerve by the current spread in the middle cranial fossa or through the mechanism similar to blink reflex. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

New innovative treatment such as deep brain stimulation of the sub-thalamic nucleus (DBS-STN) are currently under development. Endogenous mechanisms of control of epilepsies have been extensively studied in animals but pre-clinical data about the efficacy of DBS-STN especially in an animal model of neocortical seizure are still missing. This study reports the effect of DBS-STN in an animal model of focal motor epilepsy induced by local intra-cortical injection of penicillin. Here we show that DBS-STN significantly reduces the mean amplitude and significantly increases the mean number of pointes when stimulation is turned ON for several minutes. We hypothesize that DBS-STN desynchronizes the seizure activity in these specific experimental conditions. This effect is delayed and not sufficient to abort experimental seizure. This data suggests a chronic stimulation rather than a closed lood design of DBS-STN.",Click here for full text options,,,Effets de la stimulation a haute frequence du noyau subthalamique sur un modele d'epilepsie partielle motrice pharmacoresistante chez le rat.,

Method(s): Four patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy had implanted subdural electrodes for preoperative evaluation. Cortical functional mapping was performed by intermittently repeating bursts of electric stimulation, which consisted of 50 Hz alternating square pulse of 0.3 ms duration, 1-15 mA, within 5 s. The effect of this stimulation on the seizure onset zones and on the non-epileptic areas was evaluated by comparing spike frequency and electrocorticogram (ECoG) power spectra before and after stimulation. A similar comparison was performed in stimulation of 0.9 Hz of the seizure onset zones for 15 min. Result(s): When the seizure onset zone was stimulated with high frequency, spike frequency decreased by 24.7%. Logarithmic ECoG power spectra recorded at stimulated electrode significantly decreased in 10-32 Hz band by high frequency stimulation of the seizure onset zone, and in 14-32 Hz band by high frequency stimulation of the non-epileptic area. Low frequency stimulation of the seizure onset zone produced 18.5% spike reduction and slight power decrease in 12-14 Hz. Conclusion(s): Both high and low frequency electric cortical stimulation of the seizure onset zone have a suppressive effect on epileptogenicity. Reduction of ECoG fast activities after electric cortical stimulation suggests the augmentation of inhibitory mechanisms in human cortex. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subcortical nuclei such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) may provide an alternative therapy for intractable epilepsy. The authors attempted to evaluate the antiepileptic effects of DBS to these structures in an experimental seizure model. Methods. Three groups of rats were prepared. In the first two groups, the rats underwent unilateral implantation of stimulation electrodes in the STN (six rats) or the SNR (six rats). A control group received no electrodes (six rats). Kainic acid (KA) was systemically administered to induce limbic seizures, which started with focal seizures and became generalized secondarily. High-frequency electrical stimulation of the STN or SNR was begun immediately after KA administration, and changes on electroencephalography (EEG) and the magnitude of clinical seizures were evaluated. Results showed that STN stimulation significantly reduced the duration of generalized seizures on EEG, although the total duration of seizures (generalized plus focal seizures) was unchanged. The duration of focal seizures on EEG was prolonged by STN DBS, a result possibly due to the suppression of secondary generalization. In addition, STN DBS reduced the severity of clinical seizures. On the other hand, stimulation of the SNR demonstrated no effect. Conclusions. Unilateral STN DBS showed significant suppression of the secondary generalization of limbic seizures. Note, however, that SNR DBS was less effective, which implies that in addition to the nigral control of the epilepsy system, another antiepileptic mechanism such as antidromic stimulation of the corticosubthalamic pathway should be considered.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Post-spike inhibition was described in experimental models but was never demonstrated in the human epileptic cortex. In the present study post-spike excitability was retrospectively evaluated on intracerebral stereo- electroencephalographic recordings performed in the epileptogenic cortex of five patients suffering from drug-resistant focal epilepsy secondary to Taylor-type neocortical dysplasias. Patients typically presented with highly periodic interictal spiking activity at 2.33 +/- 0.87 Hz (mean +/- SD) in the dysplastic region. During the stereo-electroencephalographic procedure, low-frequency stimulation at 1 Hz was systematically performed for diagnostic purposes to identify the epileptogenic zone. The probability of evoking an IS during the interspike period in response to 1-Hz stimuli delivered close to the ictal-onset zone was examined. Stimuli that occurred early after a spontaneous IS (within 70% of the inter-IS period) had a very low probability of generating a further IS. On the contrary, stimuli delivered during the late inter-IS period had the highest probability of evoking a further IS. The generation of stimulus-evoked ISs is occluded for several hundred milliseconds after the occurrence of a preceding spike discharge. As previously shown in animal models, these findings suggest that, during focal, periodic interictal spiking, human neocortical excitability is phasically controlled by post-spike inhibition. © Federation of European Neuroscience Societies.",Click here for full text options,,,,

treatment outcome","Open-loop stimulation studies have shown varying control of seizures with stimulation of different anatomical targets. A recent multi-institutional clinical study utilizing an external closed-loop stimulation system had promising results. A novel implantable closed-loop Responsive Neurostimulation System (RNS) (Neuropace, Inc., Mountainview, Calif., USA) consisting of a cranially implanted pulse generator, one or two quadripolar subdural strip or depth leads and a programmer is under testing in a prospective clinical trial. The RNS pulse generator continuously analyzes the patient's electrocortigrams (ECoGs) and automatically triggers electrical stimulation when specific ECoG characteristics programmed by the clinician, as indicative of electrographic seizures or precursor of epileptiform activities, are detected. The pulse generator then stores diagnostic information detailing detections and stimulations, including multichannel stored ECoGs. The RNS programmer communicates transcutaneously with the implanted pulse generator when initiated by a clinician. The RNS programmer can download diagnostics and store ECoGs for review. The RNS programmer can then be used to program detection and stimulation parameters. In our current communication, we describe the selection criteria for implanting this system, the preparation of the surgical candidates as well as the surgical technique. We also present our preliminary results with 8 patients who had an RNS implanted. Seven patients (87.5%) had more than 45% decrease in their seizure frequency. The mean follow-up time in our series was 9.2 months. The implantation of a closed-loop stimulation system, in our experience, represents a safe and relatively simple surgical procedure. However, the efficacy of this new treatment modality remains to be determined in further multi-institutional, prospective clinical studies. Copyright © 2005 S.

The controls were 35 healthy subjects. Semantic memory was assessed by means of Picture Naming, Picture Pointing, the verbal Pyramid and Palm Trees Test (PPTT), the visual PPTT, Object Decision Hard, and Drawing From Memory. Episodic memory was assessed by means of the Short Story, Rey's Complex Figure, the Verbal and Visual Selective Reminding Procedure and Brown-Peterson Procedure. Factor analysis of the epilepsy patients distinguished their semantic memory scores from other neuropsychological domains. The semantic memory factor was significantly related to the side of the epileptic region, with lower scores in the left hemisphere and left TLE patients. In comparison with the controls, the left TLE patients were significantly impaired on Picture Naming, Picture Pointing, and Object Decision Hard. Subsequent analyses showed that, in comparison with the controls and the right TLE patients, the left TLE patients with lateral temporal lobe lesions were impaired in Picture Naming whereas, in comparison with the controls, the left TLE patients with mesial temporal lobe lesions were impaired in Object Decision Hard. On the contrary, the episodic memory factor was not related to the side of the epileptic region, and a few material-specific tests revealed opposite impairments in the left and right hemisphere patients. These results show that left TLE may cause semantic memory deficits involving verbal and visual information. Unlike the material-specific pattern of episodic memory, this pattern of impairment is in line with the view of an amodal semantic store in which all of the information about a thing overlaps. The semantic memory impairment may reflect damage in the lateral and mesial temporal lobe regions that impair neocortical functions in storing and retrieving information or hippocampal functions in processing meaningful stimuli. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

treatment outcome","Surgery of drug resistant epilepsy in children is a functional surgery which aims at the suppression of the epileptogenic focus. The surgical decision is adopted or rejected as a result of the clinical examination and complementary investigations following a multidisciplinary discussion in which the benefit-risk ratio is being carefully weighed. The objective of the presurgical investigations, dominated by scalp-recorded Video-electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging, is the localization of the epileptogenic focus. The invasive surgical investigations with intracranial electrode placement are indicated when the limits of a planned resection have to be defined precisely or when the focus is located nearby a functionally eloquent region (sensori-motor and language region). Their identification is possible by means of electrical stimulation. Two methods of exploration are available: The combination of subdural and intracerebral electrode placement through craniotomy and the stereotactic placement of intracerebral depth electrodes (Stereo-EEG). The choice of either of these two methods depends on the child's age and on the topography of the epileptogenic focus. Surgery can be either palliative, with the purpose of reducing the intensity and/or the frequency of a certain seizure type (callosotomy, multiple subpial transsections) or curative, aiming at a suppression of the epileptognic focus through a resective or a disconnective surgical procedure. We have operated on a population of 148 children and infants between 3 months and 10 years of age during the years 1993 to 2001: In the infant group, dysplastic lesions represented the predominant etiology. In the age group of 3 to 10 years, the underlying pathology was more distributed (dysplastic lesions, epileptogenic tumors, Rasmussen's encephalitis, hypothalamic hamartomas). Extratemporal focal resections required, in the majority of cases, an invasive preoperative exploration and hemispherotomy was frequent in this group (44 p. 100). Sixty-seven percent of the children were seizure-free, with an acceptable morbidity rate, primarily due to shunt placement following hemispherotomy in children with dysplastic lesions. Our preliminary results concerning quality of life and socialization are encouraging and favor surgical treatment at an early stage.",Click here for full text options,"*antiepileptic drug resistance [other term]

Our recent experience during mapping and resection of a lesion in sensorimotor cortex supports the idea that epileptogenic lesions may prompt development of alternate cortical motor representations. Multimodal mapping may uncover alternate areas of functionality that make surgery feasible even when conventional neuroanatomy suggests otherwise. Newer methods such as electrocorticographic spectral analysis may complement traditional electrical cortical stimulation mapping. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Secondly, we wished to determine the percentage of stimulations evoking ADs and, of these, the percentage which clearly involves more than one electrode position, potentially inaccurately localizing cortical function. Thirdly, we wished to quantify the incidences of the several AD morphologies described by Jasper [in: Epilepsy and the functional anatomy of the human brain, 1954, p. 183; p. 692] and to assess whether certain morphologies had a greater tendency to evolve in frequency or morphology. Method(s): In these 29 patients requiring invasive recordings to determine principal epileptogenic areas, only subdural strips were placed in 19 patients, only grids in 2 patients, and both in 8 patients. A median of 21 electrodes per patient was stimulated of a median of 63 electrodes placed, with the following parameters: biphasic, monopolar, 50 Hz, 0.3 ms pulse duration, 1.5-18 mA. Coverage involved the frontal and parietal lobes (9 patients), frontal parietal temporal lobes (8), frontal temporal (3), temporal (2), occipital (2) and occipital temporal (2) with other combinations in 3 additional patients. Classification of AD morphologies was determined by a pilot study using IFSECN definitions [Electroenceph clin Neurophysiol 1974;37:538] and descriptions by Jasper [in: Epilepsy and the functional anatomy of the human brain, 1954, p. 183] and Gloor [in: Advances in neurology, vol. 8, 1975; p. 59]. Result(s): Four hundred and two ADs (12%) were elicited by 3358 trains of electrical stimuli of which 260 (65%) clearly involved more than only the stimulated electrode position. Thus, 260 (8%) of 3358 stimulations evoked an AD that could mislocalize cortical function. The proportion of stimulating electrodes eliciting ADs ranged among patients from 4 to 83% (median 33%). Polyspike bursts and sequential spikes were the most common AD morphologies. Ten percent of ADs evolved in morphology, frequency or both. Evolution occurred more commonly (44%) with rhythmic waves than with other AD morphologies (7%). Neither evolving ADs, ADs producing clinical seizures, or ADs exceeding 10 s correlated topologically with spontaneous seizure origins. Conclusion(s): Although occurring in a minority of cortical electrical stimuli, ADs may involve more than the stimulus site and therefore may inaccurately localize cortical function. Our material failed to disclose any consistent relationship between the site of stimulus eliciting ADs and that of spontaneously appearing seizures, even when certain aspects of such ADs were analysed. Significance: These data illustrate the need for scrutiny of the post-stimulus electrocorticogram for ADs and particularly those involving extra stimulus sites. Whether varying the stimulus parameters prospectively will disclose a better seizure localizing value for ADs remains to be determined. © 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Here we present a patient with a selective deficit for the perception and discrimination of auditory motion following resection of the right anterior temporal lobe and the right posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG). Analysis of stimulus identity and location within the auditory scene remained intact. In addition, intracranial auditory evoked potentials, recorded preoperatively, revealed motion-specific responses selectively over the resected right posterior STG, and electrical cortical stimulation of this region was experienced by the patient as incoming moving sounds. Collectively, these data present a patient with cortical motion deafness, providing evidence that cortical processing of auditory motion is performed in a specialized module within the posterior STG.",Click here for full text options,*cortical motion deafness [other term],,,

Male Wistar rats were stereotactically implanted in the right amygdala with a bipolar electrode. Rats (n=14) received twice daily LFS (15 min train of 1 Hz, 0.1 ms at an intensity of 100 to 400 muA) immediately after amygdala kindling stimulation (1 s train of 60 Hz biphasic square waves, each 1 ms at amplitude of 200-500 muA) during 20 days. The LFS suppressed epileptogenesis (full attainment of stage V kindling) but not the presence of partial seizures (lower stages of kindling) in 85.7% of the rats. Thereafter, normal rats (n=7) received amygdala LFS twice daily for 40 trials. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after last stimulation and their brain used for labeling mu opioid, benzodiazepine (BZD), alpha1-adrenergic, and adenylyl cyclase binding. Autoradiography experiments revealed increased BZD receptor binding in basolateral amygdala (20.5%) and thalamus (29.3%) ipsilateral to the place of stimulation and in contralateral temporal cortex (18%) as well as decreased values in ipsilateral frontal cortex (24.2%). Concerning mu receptors, LFS decreased binding values in ipsilateral sensorimotor (7.2%) and temporal (5.6%) cortices, dentate gyrus (5.8% ipsi and 6.8% contralateral, respectively), and contralateral CA1 area of dorsal hippocampus (5.5%). LFS did not modify alpha1 receptor and adenylyl cyclase binding values. These findings suggest that the antiepileptic effects of LFS may involve activation of GABA-BZD and endogenous opioid systems. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

vagus nerve stimulation","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective and most rapidly acting treatment for severe treatment resistant major depression, but its use is limited by its cognitive side effects. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a new form of convulsive therapy using high-dosage repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to induce focal cortical seizures under anesthesia. MST is under study as a means of reducing the side effects of ECT through the enhanced control over the sites of seizure initiation and topography of seizure propagation afforded by the relative focality of rTMS. This review traces the stages in the development of MST, from device development, to preclinical testing, to clinical trials. The results of a study on the comparative safety of chronic MST and electroconvulsive shock in non-human primates support the safety of both interventions, and indicate that the seizures induced by MST are more focal and have less impact on deeper brain structures. This non-human primate model and a controlled clinical trial in patients with major depression, suggest that MST may induce fewer side effects and less amnesia than ECT. Ongoing work will yield the first data on the antidepressant efficacy of MST. If ultimately shown to be effective, MST could represent a new, less invasive option for patients with severe treatment resistant depression or other disorders who would otherwise require ECT. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper reviews the evidence that exogenously applied NPY receptor ligands can inhibit epileptic seizures in various rodent in vitro and in vivo models. Agonists at Y2 and/or Y5 receptors and antagonists at Y1 receptors appear to inhibit seizures, depending on the seizure model studied. Although progress has been made, further studies are needed using transgenic animals as well as novel selective agonists and antagonists to firmly identify the NPY receptors mediating antiepileptic effects. This may lead to the development of future antiepileptic drug treatments targeting the NPY system. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

upregulation","The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is ubiquitous in the central nervous system (CNS) throughout life. In addition to trophic effects on target neurons, BDNF appears to be part of a general mechanism for activity-dependent modification of synapses in the developing and adult nervous system. Thus, diseases of abnormal trophic support (such as neurodegenerative diseases) and diseases of abnormal excitability (such as epilepsy and central pain sensitization) can be related in some cases to abnormal BDNF signaling. For example, various studies have shown that BDNF is upregulated in areas implicated in epileptogenesis, and interference with BDNF signal transduction inhibits the development of the epileptic state. Further study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which BDNF influences cell survival and excitability will likely provide novel concepts and targets for the treatment of diverse CNS diseases.",Click here for full text options,,,,

transcranial magnetic stimulation","Objective: To use paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate cortical excitability in drug-naive patients with partial epilepsy. Method(s): Twenty-one drug-naive patients with partial epilepsy and 15 control subjects were studied. The relaxed threshold to TMS, the central silent period, and the intracortical inhibition/facilitation were measured. Statistics implied cluster analysis methods. Also assessed were the patient interictal EEG epileptiform abnormalities (EAs) on a semiquantitative basis. Then the TMS was contrasted to the clinical and EEG findings, using chi2 or Fisher exact tests. Result(s): One-third of the patients made up a ""pathologic"" cluster with a disrupted intracortical inhibition (p < 0.01). Two-thirds had a normal inhibition. Interictal EAs predominated in the pathologic cluster, for frequency (p < 0.04), duration (p < 0.04), and focality (p < 0.02). Conclusion(s): Intracortical inhibition, which was impaired in one-third of the patients, reflects gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity within cortical area 4. Defective GABA inhibition is a typical pathogenic factor in partial epilepsy. Transcranial magnetic stimulation proved able to detect it. The weaker cortical inhibition had a direct relation to the severity of interictal epileptiform abnormalities.",Click here for full text options,,,,

There are some limitations, MR contraindications to scanning, motion, and cooperation among them. Yet for most patients fMR imaging provides a reliable way to lateralize language dominance and to guide localization of language functions. Memory paradigms lag behind language in practical application, but the impediments to its utility will likely be resolved in the near future.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Increasing availability of equipment capable of providing good-quality intra-MR imaging EEG with relative ease should ensure a more widespread application of the technique in neurology and neuroscience. Early findings in epilepsy have raised a number of interesting issues related to the localization of the activations and the time course of the event-related response that require further investigation. These investigations will benefit from substantial increases in sensitivity resulting from recent and forthcoming technical developments. Validation of the findings will require comparison with invasive and postsurgical findings and further correlations with other measures of brain activity, which should also lead to an improved understanding of the underlying phenomena. To facilitate comparison of findings, improved reporting standards are needed - namely, illustration of activation maps using the glass-brain - more consistent threshold selection, and the listing of all activation clusters, including their volumes, maximum (or minimum) z scores, and peak signal change.",Click here for full text options,,,,

*vagus nerve stimulation","Purpose: To measure vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)-induced cerebral blood flow (CBF) effects after prolonged VNS and to compare these effects with immediate VNS effects on CBF. Method(s): Ten consenting partial epilepsy patients had positron emission tomography (PET) with intravenous [15O]H 2O. Each had three control scans without VNS and three scans during 30 s of VNS, within 20 h after VNS began (immediate-effect study), and repeated after 3 months of VNS (prolonged study). After intrasubject subtraction of control from stimulation scans, images were anatomically transformed for intersubject averaging and superimposed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for anatomic localization. Changes on t-statistical maps were considered significant at p < 0.05 (corrected for multiple comparisons). Result(s): During prolonged studies, CBF changes were not observed in any regions that did not have CBF changes during immediate-effect studies. During both types of studies, VNS-induced CBF increases were similarly located in the bilateral thalami, hypothalami, inferior cerebellar hemispheres, and right postcentral gyrus. During immediate-effect studies, VNS decreased bilateral hippocampal, amygdalar, and cingulate CBF and increased bilateral insular CBF; no significant CBF changes were observed in these regions during prolonged studies. Mean seizure frequency decreased by 25% over a 3-month period between immediate and prolonged PET studies, compared with 3 months before VNS began. Conclusion(s): Seizure control improved during a period over which some immediate VNS-induced CBF changes declined (mainly over cortical regions), whereas other VNS-induced CBF changes persisted (mainly over subcortical regions). Altered synaptic activities at sites of persisting VNS-induced CBF changes may reflect antiseizure actions.",Click here for full text options,,,,

tonic seizure / drug therapy","The nootropic drug piracetam was investigated in various experimental models of epilepsy. Generally, piracetam exhibits no or only moderate anticonvulsant properties against generalized tonic or clonic seizures. However, in many cases it did increase the anticonvulsant effectiveness of conventional antiepileptics, as shown in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) threshold test, the traditional MES test or in DBA/2 mice. A pharmacokinetic interaction does not seem to be responsible for this effect. In lethargic mice, a model of absence seizures, piracetam significantly decreased the incidence and duration of spike-wave discharges. Furthermore, in the cobalt-induced focal epilepsy model piracetam reduced the number of spikes/min and in the hippocampal stimulation model it increased the anticonvulsant potency of phenobarbital and phenytoin after single and repeated administration. In conclusion, the well tolerated piracetam itself did not show marked anticonvulsant effects in most screening tests, however, its co-medication with antiepileptic drugs improved seizure protection in various models which may bear potential clinical significance. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",Click here for full text options,,,,"Arzneimittelwerk Dresden [Germany]

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a lexical processing task revealed an atypical organization of language represented by an interhemispheric dissociation of language regions with a right frontal dominance and a left temporal dominance. Consistent with the fMRI results, the patient's ability to name pictures was not reliably impaired by electrocortical stimulation (ECS) of left frontal cortex. The findings from Wada, fMRI, and ECS were confirmed by a lack of language impairment after left frontal lobectomy for seizures. This case illustrates that fMRI can precisely map cortical language networks in epileptic patients and that fMRI may be used to help interpret laterality results provided by the Wada procedure. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

*vagus nerve stimulation","Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an important option for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Through delivery of a battery-supplied intermittent current, VNS protects against seizure development in a manner that correlates experimentally with electrophysiological modifications. However, the mechanism by which VNS inhibits seizures in humans remains unclear. The impairment of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neuronal inhibition associated with epilepsy has suggested that GABAA receptors might contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of VNS. We have now applied single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist [123I]iomazenil to examine cortical GABAA receptor density (GRD) before and 1 year after implantation of a VNS device in 10 subjects with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. VNS therapeutic responses resulted significantly correlated with the normalization of GRD. Moreover, a comparable control group, scheduled for a possible VNS implant, failed to show significant GRD variations after 1 year of a stable anti-epileptic treatment. These results suggest that VNS may modulate the cortical excitability of brain areas associated with epileptogenesis and that GABAA receptor plasticity contributes to this effect. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Click here for full text options,,,,Mallinckrodt [Netherlands]

Method(s): Event-related potentials (ERPs) were epicortically recorded from PM in 5 epilepsy patients. S1-Go/NoGo choice delayed reaction time (RT), S1-warned S2-Go simple RT and control fixation paradigms were compared using paired visual stimuli (S1, S2). Result(s): Signal-related activity peaked at 176-194 ms after S1 in the ventrorostral PM (PMvr) in all 3 paradigms, indicating its role in signal perception. Early set-related activity was recorded with its peak <810 ms after S1 in the dorsorostral PM (PMdr) and was larger in the choice than in the simple RT paradigm, suggesting its role in signal selection. Its cognitive component was recorded as surface-positive transients at PMdr, while its motoric aspect, seen as negative transients, extended to the caudal PM. Late sustained set-related activity was observed in preparation for hand movement in the caudal PM at the hand and face positive motor areas. After presentation of S2, movement-related activity was observed at the hand sensorimotor area for motor execution, following the signal-related activity at PMvr. Conclusion(s): The present ERP study suggests the temporally sequential representation of predominantly 'cognitive' function in the rostral PM and 'motor' function in the caudal PM. Significance: The rostrocaudal cognitive-motor gradient was demonstrated in the lateral premotor cortex in humans by means of an epicortical ERP approach. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Method(s): Nine patients (4 males, 5 females) with drug-resistant partial epileptic seizures were investigated using stereotactically implanted electrodes in the parietal cortex, posterior to vertical anterior commissure plane and in the frontal opercular region rostral to vertical anterior commissure (VAC). Result(s): The main finding of this study is the recording of an early somatosensory evoked potential, (N30op), by chronically implanted electrodes in the SII area of 8 epileptic patients. In 3 patients where SEPs were performed after ipsilateral median nerve (MN) stimulation, a N30op was recorded 5.8+/-2 ms later than contralateral one. Conclusion(s): This is the first report of early SEPs recorded by electrodes implanted in SII area. The N30op potential, even if less consistent than later potentials, confirmed the important role of the SII area in the early processing of somatosensory inputs. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

In four patients with focal epilepsy and subdural electrodes, focal clonus was elicited by electrical stimulation of the motor cortex. Three additional patients underwent intraoperative stimulation of the spinal cord. Rhythmic clonic muscle responses were elicited by cortical stimulation with 20-50 Hz. The clonus consisted of simultaneous trains of compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) in agonistic and antagonistic muscles alternating with periods of muscular silence despite continuous stimulation. Clonus frequency decreased from 4.0-8.0 Hz at 50 Hz stimulation to 3.0-3.5 Hz at 20 Hz paralleled by a prolongation of the trains of CMAP. The stimulation frequency correlated with the number of stimuli blocked during relaxation. During the stable stimulation periods, the clonus frequency decreased over time. The number of stimuli which formed a train of CMAP and which were blocked during relaxation increased towards the end of the stimulation periods. Increasing intensity of stimulation at the same frequency converted a clonic to a tonic response. There was always an 1:1 relationship between stimulus and CMAP during spinal cord stimulation. We hypothesize that during cortical stimulation, clonus is elicited by synchronous activation of pyramidal tract (PT) neurons which results in excitation of intracortical GABABergic interneurons by recurrent axon-collaterals. This leads to stepwise hyperpolarization of PT neurons intermittently suppressing the output of PT neurons despite continuous stimulation. This mechanism can explain our finding that temporal and spatial summation of the stimuli were needed for clonus generation. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We evaluated by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) the eloquent areas in 7 patients (1 male, 6 female, mean age 32,8 +/- 13,7 yrs.) with partial epilepsy and different MCDs: giant heterotopia (1), subependimal heterotopia (1), band heterotopia (1), polymicrogyria (1), focal cortical dysplasia (3). In 4 patients the sensorimotor cortex has been acfivated by finger tapping and cutaneous stimulation; in 4 patients, with MCD involving the left hemisphere, the language areas have been activated by phonemic fluency and verbal denomination. Sensorimotor areas showed a larger activation in the affected hemisphere, and in three patients the activation involved the dysplasic tissue. A partial shift of the language areas has been also observed, with an activation cluster within the dysplasic tissue in one patient. In conclusion, fMRI is an adequate tool to map the eloquent cortex in patients with MCD. The activation within the dysplasic tissues suggests its involvement in the normal cerebral function.",Click here for full text options,,,Valutazione delle aree eloquenti nelle malformazioni dello sviluppo corticale mediante risonanza magnetica funzionale.,

*wada test","Purpose: To analyze the role of selective middle cerebral artery (MCA) Wada tests in the presurgical workup of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsies. Method(s): Twenty MCA Wada test procedures were performed to identify eloquent cortex (a) in nine patients with hemispheric lesions involving the motor cortex (connatal MCA infarct, n = 5; unilateral cortical dysplasia, n = 3; Rasmussen encephalitis, n = 1), (b) five patients with circumscribed neoplastic or nonneoplastic lesions adjacent to the motor cortex or classic language areas, and (c) for purely electrophysiologic reasons, in two patients with electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES). Sodium amobarbital and [99mTc]-HMPAO were simultaneously injected via a microcatheter into the distal M1 segment (n = 7), the inferior MCA trunk (n = 3), or into MCA branches (n = 10). Result(s): Co-registered single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n = 18) showed that sodium amobarbital did not reach the target area in three procedures. Temporary neurologic deficits occurred in 12 procedures. Eleven patients were operated on with the following surgical approaches: functional hemispherectomy, n = 3; partial or extended lesionectomy, n = 4; anterior temporal lobectomy, n = 1; and multiple subpial transsections, n = 3. Seizure freedom (Engel class I) was achieved in five patients. Conclusion(s): Selective MCA Wada tests can contribute to risk assessment concerning postsurgical motor deficits before functional hemispherectomy. Other indications are less clear: The identification of language areas is targeted primarily by electrical-stimulation mapping after subdural grid implantations, and selective MCA Wada tests in ESES patients yet have to be validated in larger patient groups.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Agonists for Y1, Y2 and Y5 receptors reduced seizure-like activity in hippocampal cultures. Intracerebral injection of NPY or Y5 agonists reduced the expression of focal seizures produced by a single electrical stimulation of the hippocampus. Conversely, NPY agonists increased the duration of generalized convulsive seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol. These results suggest that NPY reduces seizures of hippocampal origin through activation of Y5 receptors. They also point to probable modulatory effects of NPY in brain structures other than the hippocampus, involved in initiation, propagation or control of seizures. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Click here for full text options,,,,"Sigma

We tried to reduce these uncertainties inherent in current presurgical FMRI. For this, a new high quality head fixation device was used to detect reliably activated voxels over repeated measurements. In addition high correlation thresholds were applied to define the areas with highest probability of activation. The results show a focussing of such functional high risk areas to only a few voxels which localized close to intraoperative cortical stimulation. The generation of such FMRI risk maps may improve validity of clinical localization and facilitate the development of currently missing standards for maximized but still safe tumor resection.

Two subregions in the SMA were identified based on the anatomical location and the different response to cortical stimulation. In three of the four subjects, we also recorded MRCPs from the surface of the lateral convexity covering the primary sensorimotor areas (SI-MI), which were defined by cortical stimulation and SEP recording. The subjects extended the middle finger or opposed the thumb against other fingers of the same hand at a self-paced rate of 0.2 Hz (slow) and 2 Hz (rapid), each in separate sessions. As a result, pre- and postmovement potentials were clearly seen at the SI-MI in both slow- and rapid-rate movements. By contrast, in the SMA, especially in the pre-SMA, premovement potentials were not seen and postmovement potentials were seldom seen in the rapid rate movement. In the slow-rate condition, pre- and postmovement potentials were clearly seen in both the pre-SMA and the SMA proper. In conclusion, the SMA, especially the pre-SMA, is less activated electrophysiologically in the rapid-rate movements, while the SI-MI remains active regardless of the movement rate.",Click here for full text options,,,,

temporal lobe epilepsy","A 23-year-old woman with refractory complex partial seizures underwent implantation of subdural grid electrodes over the left hemisphere to map epileptic foci and language function. Aphasic symptoms occurred during stimulation of the basal temporal area, which were always associated with intrastimulus remote discharges (ISRDs) in the classical posterior language area. No sequential language deficits occurred after anterior temporal lobectomy including the basal temporal area. These results suggest a close functional relationship between the basal temporal area and posterior language area in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. ISRDs may explain the paradoxical observation that resection of the basal temporal language area results in no language deficits.

seizure / etiology","Partial epileptic seizures are known to cause a focal increase in cerebral blood how (CBF). However, quantified studies of ictal CBF changes under intracranial EEG control are still needed to assess the relationships in time and space between CBF changes and electrical discharges. Ten patients undergoing an intracerebral stereotaxic EEG (stereo-EEG) investigation for epilepsy surgery were prospectively studied for local perfusion changes. These were measured by H215O-PET during 12 subclinical or mild symptomatic focal epileptic discharges induced by intracerebral electrical stimulation of the hippocampus (eight), amygdala (two), temporal pole (one) and fusiform gyrus (one). This study aimed to assess whether a significant focal blood flow change reflected the geographical extent of the underlying coincident epileptic discharge, as measured by this method at seizure onset. No significant CBF change was observed on test-retest at rest or during ineffective electrical stimulations outside the epileptogenic area. Compared with the resting condition, a significant focal perfusion increase of 16-55% occurred during eight discharges, there was no CBF change in three and a significant CBF decrease in one. Ictal CBF increases were mostly associated with low-voltage fast activity, but their magnitude had no obvious link with the duration of the discharge (range 8-106 s). Regional analysis of ictal PET was performed in 10 anatomical areas during each of the 12 discharges. Of all the 120 regions, 59 were not explored by intracerebral electrodes and 14 (24%) of these demonstrated ictal CBF changes. In 43 of the 61 regions explored by stereo-EEG (70.5%), PET and depth EEG findings converged, showing either a CBF change in a discharging area or no CBF change in a region unaffected by the discharge. Areas of increased CBF indicated an underlying epileptic discharge in almost 100% of the cases. Conversely, of the 18 regions showing discrepancies between intracerebral recordings and PET data, 17 were discharging regions showing no ictal CBF changes. Thus, a focal CBF increase, when detected at the seizure onset concomitantly with the initial low-voltage fast activity, was a reliable marker of an underlying epileptic discharge. It emphasizes the importance of injecting blood-flow tracers as soon as possible after detection of the discharge in routine clinical studies, even at a subclinical stage of the seizure. However, the extent of significant ictal CBF changes can be more restricted than that of the electrical discharge, thus limiting the reliability of ictal CBF images for outlining the contours of a tailored cortectomy.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Method(s): The event- related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu rhythm was quantified during a self-paced voluntary movement of the thumb. The results were compared between two groups of patients with epilepsy: in one group (n = 12), the patients had frontal lobe epilepsy with frequent focal motor seizures (FMS); in the second group (n = 12), they had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with complex partial seizures but no ictal movement disorder. The results were also compared with those of control subjects of same age (n = 10). Result(s): In the control group, desynchronization of mu rhythm began over the contralateral central region 2,000 ms before the movement onset. In the FMS group, the desynchronization of mu rhythm was delayed, appearing only 500 ms before the movement onset, and the amplitude of ERD was increased over the frontocentral region. In the TLE group, the spatiotemporal pattern of ERD was the same as in normal subjects, but the amplitude of ERD was increased. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that there is a change of reactivity of mu rhythm in patients with partial epilepsy. The change in spatiotemporal pattern of ERD in patients with frequent focal motor seizures suggests that there is an abnormal cortical activation during the planning of a voluntary movement.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Eleven patients had additional resective surgery in the anterior temporal (n = 10) or anterior temporal and frontopolar (n = 1) regions. Eleven of the 13 patients had at least 90% reduction in seizure frequency. Dysnomia was present >6 months postoperatively in 9 patients (mild, 6; moderate, 3). Other deficits included impaired memory (mild, 3; moderate, 1) and reading (mild, 2). We compared the postoperative neuropsychologic findings in 7 patients with MST and temporal lobectomy with those in 14 patients who underwent only dominant temporal lobectomy. MST patients had significantly (p < 0.05) poorer postoperative naming, verbal fluency, and oral reading than patients with dominant temporal resections that spared language functions.

Stainless steel screws were placed on the dura over bilateral motor cortex (Cx). One week after the surgery, rats were placed in the recording chamber. Kainic acid (KA) injection was performed into the left AM and focal AM seizure status was induced. Seizures evolved into limbic seizure status during 3 days. Seven days after the first KA injection, KA was injected into the right AM. The limbic seizure status was elicited again, however, these seizures subsided within 3 days. About 3 week after the first KA injection, spontaneous limbic seizures developed. Three ictal EEG patterns were seen. (1)Bilateral independent seizures, (2) Synchronous ictal discharge over the bilateral AM, and (3) Switch of lateralized ictal activity from one to the other AM. The histological study demonstrated bilateral hippocampal cell loss and hippocampal atrophy. These changes are very similar to those observed in human intractable complex partial seizures with bilateral mesial temporal focus. The result suggests that this model will be a good tool in order to resolve intractability of complex partial seizure in patients with bilateral temporal focus.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Genetically epilepsy-prone rats scoring 9 (GEPR-9s) on the seizure severity scale during audiogenic seizure (AGS) screening ('brainstem seizure-experienced') required fewer stimulations to achieve fully kindled seizures (forelimb clonus with rearing and falling) than control rats. AGS- naive GEPR-9s required an intermediate number of stimulations, indicating a role for both genetic predisposition and previous acoustically evoked brainstem seizure experience. Other forebrain kindling indices such as afterdischarge threshold/duration and seizure latency/duration also involved genetic as well as phenotypic (previous seizure experience) factors. In most GEPR-9s in both groups, severe brainstem seizures occurred after forebrain stimulation. The occurrence of brainstem seizures had a random nature and was not related to the sequence of kindling-dependent forebrain seizure progression. The lack of a difference in the occurrence of brainstem seizures between seizure-experienced and AGS-naive GEPR-9s suggest that genetic predisposition is the major factor in forebrain seizure-induced activation of brainstem seizure circuitry. This brainstem seizure activity appears to model pertinent aspects of secondary generalization observed in human partial seizures.",Click here for full text options,,,,

In the work-up prior to surgical treatment, arrays of subdural electrodes were placed over the left temporal lobe and adjacent supra-Sylvian region. Electrical stimulation of the inferior frontal cortex language region ('Broca's area') produced marked interference with language output functions including speech arrest, slowing of oral reading, paraphasia and anomia. At some cortical language sites in this region cortical stimulation also produced language comprehension deficits, particularly in response to more complex auditory verbal instructions and visual semantic material. The severe impairment of comprehension verbal information was in clear contrast with ability to process non-verbal material, which was not affected.",Click here for full text options,,,,

thalamus medialis centralis nucleus","We studied the effect of electrical stimulation of centromedian thalamic nuclei (ESCM) on seizure control and paroxysmal EEG activity in 23 patients. We report the effect of chronic ESCM on psychological performance and background EEG activity of patients with various intractable seizure patterns. In each patient, a simple specifically designed neuropsychological scales (one for adults and one for children) was administered at the end of the baseline (BL), ESCM, and poststimulation (Post) periods; and 14 consecutive EEG recordings during these periods were performed to determine the degree of neuropsychological improvement and the temporal course of EEG changes. A significant increase in psychological scores and the number of background EEG waves per 10 s was noted in groups A (generalized tonic- clonic seizures, GTC), C (complex partial seizures, CPS), and D (generalized tonic seizures) and the total group of patients from BL to ESCM and from BL to Post periods. Group B patients showed a substantial increase (partial motor seizures) during the same periods. Improvement on psychological performance correlated better with age and baseline degree of deterioration than with the nature of the particular psychological improvement in any given subtest. The improvement in EEG background rhythm was most noticeable at the end of ESCM and at the beginning of the Post periods. Complete normalization of neuropsychologic scores and EEG rhythms was rare, but improvement was significant for both. Psychological scores increased from BL 14 +/- 2 to ESCM 21 +/- 2 and Post 23 +/- 2 (normal expected 26), and EEG background rhythm increased from BL 42 +/- 2 to ESCM 62 +/- 2 and Post 54 +/- 2 EEG waves/10 s.

thalamus medialis centralis nucleus","Twenty-three patients with various intractable seizure patterns were divided into four groups based on their most frequent seizure type and their clinical and EEG response to chronic electrical stimulation of the centromedian thalamic nuclei (ESCM): group A, generalized tonic-clonic (GTC, n = 9); group B, partial motor (Rasmussen type) (n = 3); group C, complex partial seizures (CPS, n = 5); and group D, generalized tonic seizures (Lennox-Gastaut type) (n = 6). CM were radiologically and electrophysiologically localized by means of stereotaxic landmarks and by thalamically induced scalp recruitinglike responses and desynchronization. ESCM consisted of daily 2-h stimulation sessions for 3 months. Each stimulus consisted of a 1-min train of square pulses with a 4-min interstimulus interval, alternating right and left CM. Each pulse was 1.0 ms in duration at 60/s frequency and 8-15 V (400-1,250 muA) amplitude. Voltage (V), current flow (muA) and impedance (kOMEGA) at the electrode tips were kept constant. A significant decrease in the number of seizures per month and paroxysmal EEG waves per 10-s epochs occurred in group A patients between the baseline period (BL) and the ESCM period. These changes persisted for >3 months after discontinuation of ESCM (poststimulation period, Post). Post was accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of paroxysmal EEG discharges. A substantial decrease in seizures and paroxysmal discharges was also observed in patients of group B. In contrast, patients of groups C and D showed no significant changes from BL to ESCM and Post periods, except for a significant decrease in the number of seizures in group D patients from BL to Post periods.",Click here for full text options,,,,

In more than two-thirds of the patients the clinical manifestations indicated the occipital onset of the seizures. Seventy-three percent experienced visual aurae, of which elementary hallucinations were the most common and 12 also had ictal blindness. Other occipital manifestations included: contralateral eye deviation, blinking, a sensation of eye movement and nystagmoid eye movements. Intra-operative cortical stimulation elicited a habitual aura in 37% of 29 patients. Lateralizing clinical features were seen in almost two-thirds of patients: contralateral head deviation occurred in half, 59% had visual field defects contralateral to the epileptogenic area and 64% had abnormal imaging studies ipsilateral to the side of surgery. More than one-third of patients exhibited more than one seizure type, suggesting ictal spread to temporal or frontal lobe: 50% had typical temporal lobe automatisms, and 38% exhibited focal motor seizure activity. Surface electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings showed posterior temporal-occipital epileptiform discharges in 46% of patients. Only 18% had electronegative spiking limited to 01 or 02. Large epileptogenic areas were often found on intracranial recording with depth electrodes and on electrocorticography. Preexcision electrocorticography spiking was restricted to the occipital lobe in only 13 out of 34 patients. More often spiking also involved the posterior temporal and posterior parietal regions. Twenty-three patients underwent only occipital resections; five had only temporal resections, so as to preserve the visual fields, and the remaining 14 patients had extensive resections, which included the posterior temporal or posterior parietal regions. A follow-up period of 1 to 46 yrs (mean 17 yrs) was available for 37 patients. Forty-six percent became seizure free and 21% had a significant reduction in seizure frequency. A better outcome was observed in those patients in whom there was no post-resection electrocorticographic or surface EEG epileptiform discharge, or who exhibited an occipital lobe lesion.",Click here for full text options,,,,

rat","Application of penicillin to the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats by pressure ejection from a micropipette resulted in the appearance of focal epileptiform activity with low rates of penicillin release and focal penicillin spikes with higher rates. Electrical stimulation of the locus ceruleus (LC), a major norepinephrine-containing nucleus in the brainstem, or of its axons projecting to the forebrain, the dorsal noradrenergic bundle, suppressed penicillin-induced focal epileptiform activity but was less effective in suppressing focal penicillin spikes. Depletion of monoamines with reserpine blocked the suppressant effect of LC stimulation. Neither the selective depletion of 5-hydroxytryptamine with p-chlorophenylalanine nor administration of methysergide reduced the effectiveness of LC stimulation, suggesting that 5-hydroxytryptamine probably does not mediate the suppression. Pimozide partially antagonized the suppression of focal epileptiform activity induced by LC stimulation, which is consistent with antagonism of alpha-adrenoceptors but not dopamine receptors. beta-Receptor antagonists did not block the suppression of focal epileptiform activity by LC stimulation, suggesting that beta-receptors are not important in the observed suppression. Prazosin, a selective alpha1-antagonist, at low doses blocked the suppression of focal epileptiform activity by LC stimulation whereas yohimbine, an alpha2-antagonist enhanced the stimulation-induced suppression. Taken together, the data are consistent with LC and dorsal bundle stimulation releasing norepinephrine, which in turn suppresses focal epileptiform activity by an action mediated by an alpha1-adrenoceptor.",Click here for full text options,suppression [other term],,,"ciba geigy

Spike depression occurred instantly after the onset of feedback stimulation, became stable after 3-4 days of operant training, and persisted with very little current reinforcement in a daily training schedule. No comparable effects were obtained either by random CN stimulation or by contingent stimulations of other subcortical structures such as the thalamus, the mesencephalic reticular formation, or the hypothalamus. A recovery of recurrent inhibitory caudate-cortical loops is presumed to contribute to the progressive normalization of cortical excitability obtained by training.",Click here for full text options,,,,

Ictal hypermetabolism may exceed six times the interictal rate and could represent activation of excitatory or inhibitory synapses in the epileptogenic region and its projection fields. Hypometabolism seen on ictal scans most likely reflects postictal depression and may indicate projection fields of inhibited neurons.

The effects of several doses of carbamazepine, clonazepam, and phenytoin were examined on the threshold for electrically induced afterdischarge in amygdala and cortex in 71 rats. All three drugs were found to be effective in increasing the seizure threshold with greater effects being produced in the cortex than in the amygdala. Carbamazepine produced the largest threshold increase in both foci, and clonazepam produced the weakest effects. These data are comparable to previous data on drug action against focal or partial seizures, and suggest that anticonvulsants may control partial attacks through their action on the local seizure threshold. This theory of anticonvulsant drug action adds to the common belief that carbamazepine and phenytoin act primarily by blocking seizure spread.",Click here for full text options,,,,

The same brief seizures, as previously reported, did not produce retrograde amnesia in a conditioned emotional response CER paradigm. With repeated evocations, over several days, the AC convulsions exhibited a dramatic increase of the second clonic phase (generalized) and came to appear similar to amygdala kindled convulsions. These generalized AC convulsions, like briefly kindled amygdala convulsions, produced good retrograde amnesia for a CER. With extensive amygdala kindling prior to CER training, a severe CER acquisition deficit was observed.

The insertion was made as a preliminary evaluation of the response to electrical stimulation of the cerebellum in view of a planned chronic implant of cerebellar stimulation electrodes (after Cooper et al. 1973). In each patient, some degree of cerebellar participation in cerebral paroxysmal activity was noted but such synchronous spike activity in the cerebellum was less prominent than the spike discharges on the scalp or in cerebral depth leads. Spontaneous clinical seizures were recorded in 2 patients and there was marked cerebellar participation.",Click here for full text options,*ketogenic diet [other term],,,
